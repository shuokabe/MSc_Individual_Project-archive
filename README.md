This archive contains five folders:

- data contains the main used data (raw from WMT2018 task 4 and generated) for neural-based architectures, which enables to reproduce the results.
- data-generator contains the Jupyter notebooks to generate the datasets mentioned above.
- deepQuest-mod contains the files from deepQuest that were modified to enable Multimodal Quality Estimation and the files that were added (e.g. configuration files).
- QuEst++ contains the used code, configuration files and datasets for feature-based Multimodal Quality Estimation with QuEst++.
- results contains the performance of all the tested models and the results of the Williams test for the three tested approaches (document-level and sentence-level neural Multimodal QE and document-level feature-based Multimodal QE).
