knives offer security and peace of mind with their locking mechanisms that are stronger, more reliable, and easier to access than other knives'.
For Trident Series knives, this means the blade is held in place with a reliable piston lock that can be quickly released with a sliding button.
An additional safety lock offers extra security when the blade is closed, and for easy reference, the lock switch shows red when the knife is ready to be opened.Cryogenic Heat Treatment and TiNi Coating Guarantee a Sharp, Durable BladeThe TF-5 offers a full, 3.75-inch, AUS8 stainless steel blade that has undergone SOG's patented Cryogenic Heat Treatment process, which ensures that this blade will stay sharp over the long haul.
This intensive process takes more than 48 hours and involves slowly reducing the blade's temperature to less than -300 degrees Fahrenheit, then slowly heating the blade to room temperature.
The stress created by this process strengthens the steel on an atomic level and increases the blade's overall durability and edge retention.In addition to having undergone the Cryogenic Heat Treatment Process, this knife was coated in proprietary titanium nitride (TiNi), of the toughest coatings that can be applied to steel.
TiNi boasts extreme hardness, is exceptionally scratch and peel resistant, helps increase steel's longevity, and ensures low reflectivity.Ergonomic, Lightweight Design Ensures Comfortable UseEven if your blade is sharp, it's hard to make precise cuts if your knife doesn't fit comfortably in your hand.
That's why this knife's handle is ergonomically contoured.
Crafted from tough, glass-reinforced Zytel, the handle is well-balanced and features SOG's unique Digi-Grip texturing, a feature that gives you gripping power where you need it most.
Additionally, SOG's grooved handle allows you to cut heavy cord and cable without having to open the blade.At just 3.6 ounces, this folding knife is lightweight and easy to carry.
A reversible, bayonet-mounted clip extends from the back of the handle, allowing the knife to sit low in your pocket for the most discreet carry possible.
The removable clip is easily switched for right/left hand-carry.This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in manufacturing and materials.About SOG: Strong, Innovative Specialty ToolsSOG originally stood for Studies and Observation Group, an elite joint services military group designed to handle covert operations during the Vietnam War.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:Expect the WorstIn general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face.
For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in!
If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.Three- and Four-Season TentsFor summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent.
At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly.
Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities.
Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model.
Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing.
Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability.
They also tend to be more expensive.Domes, Tunnels and SacksTents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright.
Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect.
Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design.
Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel.
These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration.
Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight.
Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.Size MattersAsk yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future.
For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents.
If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket.
Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room.
Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare.
A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents.
Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group.
It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

Coleman Sundome Tent (10-Feet x 10-Feet)

Roomy enough for the whole family, the Coleman Sundome tent sleeps up to five people at a time in complete comfort.
The Sundome is outfitted with Coleman's exclusive WeatherTec system, a series of technical features intended to protect you from inclement weather and nasty storms.
WeatherTec tents are built with a coated polyester fabric combined with anti-wicking thread, webbing, and zippers, all designed to keep you dry when the rain comes down.
The tent's welded waterproof floor and inverted floor seams, meanwhile, dramatically increase the water resistance by hiding the needle holes inside the tent and away from the elements.
And in addition to offering fully taped rainfly seams, the included rainfly covers the doors and windows tightly and incorporates easy-to-use Velcro frame attachments.
In fact, Coleman is so confident in its WeatherTec system that it exposes its WeatherTec tents to a rain room that simulates nasty downpours, and to a wind machine capable of blowing hurricane force gusts.
The results?
Even after the tests, Coleman guarantees its WeatherTec tents will keep you dry.The Sundome's interior is notably spacious, with a base that measures 10 feet by 10 feet and a center height of 72 inches--plenty of headroom for most people.
In addition, the tent is engineered to keep you cool thanks to the adjustable Variflo ventilation and vented Cool-Air port.
Best of all for travel-weary campers, the Sundome sets up quickly, with two shock-corded steel poles, continuous pole sleeves, a pin-and-ring design, and InstaClip attachments.
The tent even comes with easy-to-follow instructions sewn into the durable carrying bag.
Other features include a heavy-duty welcome mat, a single door, separate bags for the poles and stakes, a privacy vent window, an interior gear pocket, and an electrical access port.The Sundome tent sleeps up to 5 people comfortably.SpecificationsCenter height: 72 inchesFly: Polyester taffeta 75 denierMesh: 68-denier polyesterFloor: 1,000-denier floor, 140 g/m2Flysheet and inner tent coating: 450mm polyurethaneBase dimensions: 10 by 10 feetPoles: 11mm fiberglassCountry of origin: Made in ChinaWarranty: Limited 1 yearAbout ColemanMore than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas.

The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil.

The array of products that bear the Coleman name now includes just about everything you might need to work or play outdoors, from tents and sleeping bags to boats, backpacks, and furniture.Amazon.com Tent GuideSelecting a TentFortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between.
Here are a few things to keep in mind:Expect the WorstIn general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face.
For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in!
If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.Three- and Four-Season TentsFor summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent.
At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly.
Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities.
Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model.
Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing.
Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability.
They also tend to be more expensive.Domes and TunnelsTents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright.
Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect.
Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design.
Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel.
These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration.
Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight.
Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.Size MattersAsk yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future.
For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents.
If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket.
Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room.
Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare.
A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents.
Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group.
It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a "no light, no pay" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark.In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns.
The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure.
There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more.
Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:Expect the WorstIn general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face.
For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in!
If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.Three- and Four-Season TentsFor summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent.
At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly.
Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities.
Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model.
Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing.
Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability.
They also tend to be more expensive.Domes, Tunnels and SacksTents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright.
Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect.
Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design.
Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel.
These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration.
Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight.
Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.Size MattersAsk yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future.
For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents.
If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket.
Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room.
Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare.
A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents.
Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group.
It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

This Coleman sleeping bag is designed to provide the most comfortable overnight stay, at home and away.Manufacturer WarrantyFive-year warrantyAmazon.com Sleeping Bag GuideSleep Well: Finding the Right Sleeping BagSleeping bag technology has come a long way from the days of cowboy bedrolls.
These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings.
Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag:Buy for ColdIt's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly.
That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips.
For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees or higher will likely do the trick.
If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35.
Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10.Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth.
Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep.
If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated ten degrees colder.
The opposite is true for "warm" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night.Goose or No Goose?The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material.
Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic.
While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios.
While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light.
There's a reason why geese can flyandstay warm through the winter!
Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use.All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market and synthetic materials are getting better all the time.
While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet.
(Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.)
If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone.
Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down--synthetic bags are non-allergenic.
Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget.Bags for All ShapesSleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use.
Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours.
This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature.
Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well.
Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space.
Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips.Pad YourselfNo matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory.
Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you.

Super 9 bolt action rifle, Black airsoft gun

A 1:1 scale replica of a bolt-action rifle, the Super 9 airsoft rifle is remarkably authentic.
The airsoft rifle fires round pellets known as BBs, which are propelled out of the gun by a spring mechanism.
The advantage of the airsoft rifle, however, is that players can safely train, simulate, or play with the gun without fearing serious injury.
The airsoft rifle looks, feels, weighs, and functions just like a real firearm, but is built for casual recreation rather than weaponized use.
In fact, the only way you can typically tell a real-steel firearm from an airsoft rifle is the blazing orange tip and the BBs that fire when you pull the trigger.
The rifle includes a hop-up system and two different magazine options: a rotary cartridge magazine that holds five shells (the shell casing ejects after each shot) and a direct feed tube magazine.
Spring guns are the toughest, most durable of all airsoft guns because they're made with the fewest breakable pieces.Specifications:Velocity: Approximately 370 fps with 0.2-gram BBs, 420 fps with 0.12-gram BBsEffective range: 117 feetCapacity: 25 rounds for direct feed, or 5 shells

Kershaw 1660CKT Ken Onion Black Leek Folding Knife with SpeedSafe

Kershaw's 1660CKT has everything the classic Leek has, plus a DLC coating of matte black.
If you prefer your knife in basic black, this one just might be your perfect EDC.
To create this matte-black look, Kershaw engineers ionize metal and deposit it on both blade and handle as a microns-thin coating.
This process results in a coating known as DLC, or Diamond-Like Carbon, which is hard and scratch resistant.
With its 3-inch blade, the Leek is a good-sized knife, but not too big.
The slim design makes it easy to carry and its razor-sharp blade of high-performance Sandvik 14C28N means it can take care of a full range of cutting tasks.
The blade is a modified drop-point, so it's a good slicing knife, while the slim tip gives it piercing capability and the ability to do detailed work.
For a partially serrated blade, choose the 1660CKTST Leek in basic black.
The Leek features the SpeedSafe ambidextrous assisted opening system.
Whether you're left-handed or right-handed, just pull back on the blade protrusion or push outward on the thumbstud and the Leek's blade is ready to go to work.
For confident blade use, a super-secure frame lock keeps the blade locked during use and a Tip-Lock slider locks the blade closed when folded.
The pocketclip can be configured for tip-up or tip-down carry and the handle is drilled to accept a lanyard.

Kershaw Ken Onion Leek Folding Knife with Speed Safe

The Leek series includes some of Kershaw's most popular knives, and the K.O.
Leek serrated folding knife is no exception.
This particular knife features a distinctive design by celebrated knife maker Ken Onion, who created the SpeedSafe ambidextrous assisted opening system.
With SpeedSafe, the user can smoothly and easily deploy the blade with one hand, either left or right.
This makes it ideal for sporting and work situations in which one-handed opening is easier and safer, such as when hunting, fishing, or working with your hands on the job site.
The K.O.
Leek also sports a bead-blasted stainless-steel handle, which gives the knife a sleek, cutting-edge look.
If the stainless handle isn't your cup of tea, Kershaw also offers Leek knives in a variety of other handle styles, some with technologically advanced coatings for enhanced performance.
For example, the red "smoked" double-anodized aluminum handle is a true head turner, while the black tungsten DLC-coated handle produces a non-reflective surface.
As an alternative, you can opt for the Pink Leek, with its fashionable pink anodized aluminum handle, or the Rainbow Leek, which boasts a titanium oxide coating that produces a highly scratch-resistant, brilliant rainbow finish.The SpeedSafe assisted opening system lets you smoothly deploy the blade with 1 hand.The K.O.
Leek also comes with a Kershaw pocket clip, which is meant to be clipped with the handle on the inside of your pocket.
The clip is not to be worn on a belt, as this is an unsafe way to carry your belt.
Other features include a frame lock, which locks the blade into position after the blade is deployed, and a thumb stud for easier one-handed opening.About the SpeedSafe SystemThe patented SpeedSafe knife-opening system helps users open the knife by applying manual pressure to the thumb stud or blade protrusion.
The heart of the SpeedSafe system--which is built into many of Kershaw's best-selling knives--is its torsion bar, which keeps gravity from opening the knife.
After the blade is out of the handle, the torsion bar moves along its half-moon track and takes over, smoothly opening the blade and locking it into position, ready for use.
Although they may look similar at first glance, SpeedSafe knives are not considered switchblades.
Unlike a switchblade, SpeedSafe knives do not deploy with the push of a button in the handle or by gravity alone.
Instead, the user must manually overcome the torsion bar's resistance, putting the knives outside the federal definition of a switchblade.
However, it's the responsibility of the buyer to investigate and comply with the laws and regulations that apply in his or her specific area.
Buyers should rest assured, however, that SpeedSafe knives are extremely safe, as they open only when the user manually deploys them, and lock securely into position when open so they don't close accidentally.Knife Maker Ken OnionA master of his trade, Ken Onion is one of the most sought-after custom knife makers in the industry.
His knives can be found in the most prestigious private knife collections as well in as in the pockets of his dedicated customers.
Ken's involvement in the knife trade dates back to his time in Palestine, West Virginia, where he was inspired at the age of 12 by Vernon Ott, a local blacksmith and maker of garden tools and knives.
In the ensuing years, Ken joined the U.S. Marine Corps and worked in such fields as construction, heavy equipment repair, and hydraulics repair, always with an eye toward eventually designing the perfect knife.
In November of 1991, Ken met Stan Fujisaki, a talented knife maker who agreed to teach him the tricks of the trade.
After years of preparation--and some inspiration while working on a Harley cam for a friend--Ken created his first SpeedSafe knife.
Today, Ken designs a custom selection of knives for Kershaw, many featuring the patented SpeedSafe torsion bar system for assisted opening.
Ken is personally involved throughout the design and manufacturing process to ensure that each knife meets his high standards for performance and quality.Specifications:Blade material: Sandvik 13C26 stainless steelHandle: 410 stainless steelBlade length: 3 inchesClosed length: 4 inchesWeight: 3 ouncesWarranty: Limited lifetimeItem is restricted for shipping to some zip codes

They offer the same aerobic benefits of riding a bicycle at any time, in any weather, without leaving the comfort and safety of home.
Exercise bikes don't take up much space, require little or no balance or coordination, and can provide an effective workout for all levels of users, from beginners to serious competitors.
While the same could be said for a number of other types of home fitness equipment, the exercise bike is one of the few that allows you to watch television or read a magazine while you work out.The term recumbent literally means "lying down."
Exercising in a recumbent or reclining position allows the user to have full ergonomic back support, without causing strain on the arms, neck and shoulders, all of which can be common effects of using an upright bicycle.
For many people, having convenient access to quality exercise equipment is critical to sticking with a long-term exercise program.

Andy Mac Zon Complete Skateboard (7.625 x 31.625)

Designed by world champion skateboarder Andy Macdonald, Andy Mac Skateboards are extremely high quality at an affordable price.
The boards are suitable for beginning skateboard enthusiasts as well as advanced skaters.Manufactured by Skate One Corporation, a leading skateboard builder for 29 years, the Andy Mac Zon Skateboard has been carefully designed and developed using the highest-quality materials and manufacturing equipment.A Message from Andy MacdonaldSkateboarding has always been, first and for most, about having fun.
As a professional, I've always wanted to be able to give back to the sport that has given me so much.
One way to do that is to make skateboarding--fun skateboarding--more accessible to more kids.
That's the idea behind Andy Mac Skateboards.The age at which kids begin skateboarding has become much younger in the past five years.
In most instances, these new skaters are not buying their boards at specialty skate shops.
Rather, they get their board where their parents shop--at a discounter, mass merchandiser or a sporting goods chain.
Most all skateboards found at these retailers are designed as toys, not sports equipment, meaning the quality and performance is poor, and the experience of using them not fun.And I was getting pretty tired of seeing kids have a bad first experience on their new skateboard.
"Toy" skateboards are available just about everywhere these days and they cost about twenty bucks.
Although they look like true skateboards, they definitely are not.
Arealskateboard turns when you want it to turn and has wheels that grip and roll smoothly.
Traditionally, the only place to find such a product was in a specialty shop, where even a first-time skater must spend more than a hundred dollars for a "complete" board.
That&rsquo;s a lot of money for a new skater or their parent to spend--more than most can afford.
That's where my brand comes in.An Andy Mac complete costs $59.99 and is the perfect entry-level skateboard.
These are real boards--the same exact board Iridewhen I street skate.
And I even use a modified version of this board in all my vert competitions!
I spent two years developing this board with Powell Skateboards, a company that has been building skateboards for almost thirty years.
The idea was that if we can build it good enough for me, it&rsquo;ll be good enough for any new skater.I want kids to have an awesome first experience skateboarding and I know my boards can provide that.
My hope is that kids all over the world will discover the same fun and enjoyment I get from skateboarding every day.So enjoy, and please let me know how you like this board.
There is truly no other board on the market like it.Peace,Andy MacdonaldAbout Andy Macdonald:Eight-time World Cup Skateboarding overall points championEight-time X-Games gold medalistSet a Guinness world record for his skateboard ramp jump of nearly 57 feetHis image was published on a U.S. postage stampHonored by President Bill Clinton at the White House for his participation in The Partnership for a Drug-Free America

The Big Agnes founders think it represents a little bit of each and everything in between.
The folks at Big Agnes have spent a lot of time in the Colorado backcountry, giving them a deep appreciation of local history, places, peaks, and rivers.
From the Cross Mountain, named after a Yampa River canyon known for classic Class IV/V whitewater, to the Encampment, one of the country's most scenic wilderness river runs, to more obvious choices like the Divide Series, the company names its products after some of the most fascinating landmarks in the region.
The spring runoff near Steamboat is also pretty spectacular, so Big Agnes included a few favorite creeks to its name directory, including Sarvis, Deep, Mad, and Lost Dog.

WaterRower Club Rowing Machine in Ash Wood with S4 Monitor

Rowing has long been recognized as the perfect aerobic pursuit, with naturally smooth and flowing movements that don't tax the joints but do boost the heart rate.
Now you can take your rowing experience to the next level with the commercial-quality WaterRower Club rowing machine.
Using the same principles that govern the dynamics of  a boat in water, the WaterRower Club is outfitted with a "water flywheel" that consists of two paddles in an enclosed tank of water that provide smooth, quiet resistance, just like the paddles in an actual body of water.
As a result, the machine has no moving parts that can wear out over time (even the recoil belt and pulleys don't require lubricating or maintaining).
More significantly, the water tank and flywheel create a self-regulating resistance system that eliminates the need for a motor.
As with real rowing, when you paddle faster, the increased drag provides more resistance.
When you paddle slower, the resistance is less intense.
The only limit to how fast you can row is your strength and your ability to overcome drag.
And unlike conventional rowing machines, which tend to be jerky and jarring, the WaterRower Club is remarkably smooth and fluid.From a fitness perspective, the WaterRower Club works 84 percent of your muscle mass, helping tone and strengthen your muscles while burning far more calories than most other aerobic machines.
The exercise is also low impact, as it removes all the body weight from the ankles, knees, and hips, but still moves the limbs and joints through a full range of motion--from completely extended to completely contracted.The WaterRower Club is outfitted with a Series 4 performance monitor that's designed to balance technical sophistication with user-friendliness.
The monitor--which includes six information and programming windows, six QuickSelection buttons, and three navigation buttons--displays your workout intensity, stroke rate, heart rate, zone bar, duration, and distance.
Plus, the monitor is compatible with an optional heart rate chest strap and receiver, which helps you optimize your workout and achieve your exercise objectives.The WaterRower Club is handcrafted in solid ash and stained for color.
The wood was chosen due to its marvelous engineering properties, especially its ability to absorb sound and vibration, which enhances the WaterRower's quiet performance and smooth operation.
Ash, like all woods used in the construction of the WaterRower, is a premium hardwood with incredible longevity and dimensional stability.
In addition, the wood is harvested from replenishable forests and is hand finished with Danish oil and urethane for protection.Unlike its WaterRower Natural cousin, the WaterRower Club is designed for high-traffic areas, such as commercial gyms, studios, and rehabilitation clinics.
Its dual black rails have been styled to prevent scuffing, while the other wood components are finished in an attractive rosewood, which is more resistant to soiling than the Natural model.
Other details include four corner wheels on the rails that increase seat stability and reduce the amount of sweat buildup; a frame that flips upright for handy storage; and a weight capacity of up to 1,000 pounds.
The WaterRower Club measures 84 by 21 by 22 inches (W x H x D), weighs 117 pounds (with water), and carries a one-year warranty on the frame and components (WaterRower will upgrade the warranty to five years on the frame and three years on the components with the completion of a registration form).

PowerBlock Classic Adjustable Dumbbell Set

The only dumbbell system that can expand to meet your strength needs, PowerBlock dumbbells are the most versatile and effective exercise tool ever developed for strength training.
PowerBlocks work intuitively.
Rather than requiring you to buy a room full of dumbbells, PowerBlocks act just like a weight stack at the gym, with a weight handle that fits inside the first weight, which fits inside the second, which fits inside the third, etc.
When you want to change weights, you simply move the weight selector pin into the appropriate slot and you're set.
As you lift the core, all the weights above the selector pin are lifted at the same time, turning your 3-pound dumbbell into a 6-pound dumbbell, or your 6-pound dumbbell into a 12-pound dumbbell.
Not only is the system remarkably easy to use, but it's also cost- and space-efficient, as a single pair of dumbbells can do the work of dozens.This pair of 45x5 dumbbells, for instance, adjusts from 5 to 45 pounds in 5-pound increments (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 pounds), in effect doing the job of 18 individual weights.
Even better, the weights are more compact and balanced than traditional dumbbells, with a padded handle that protects people with weak wrists.
Best of all, the free weights are terrific whether you're trying to build muscle mass, firm and tone your physique, or get rid of unwanted body fat.
The adjustable set offers a maximum weight of 45 pounds per hand and carries a limited 10-year warranty.

WaterRower Natural Rowing Machine in Ash Wood with S4 Monitor

Rowing has long been recognized as the perfect aerobic pursuit, with naturally smooth and flowing movements that don't tax the joints but do boost the heart rate.
Now you can take your rowing experience to the next level with the WaterRower Natural rowing machine.
Using the same principles that govern the dynamics of  a boat in water, the WaterRower Natural is outfitted with a "water flywheel" that consists of two paddles in an enclosed tank of water that provide smooth, quiet resistance, just like the paddles in an actual body of water.
As a result, the machine has no moving parts that can wear out over time (even the recoil belt and pulleys don't require lubricating or maintaining).
More significantly, the water tank and flywheel create a self-regulating resistance system that eliminates the need for a motor.
As with real rowing, when you paddle faster, the increased drag provides more resistance.
When you paddle slower, the resistance is less intense.
