Yoga With Richard Freeman:  Ashtanga Yoga: The Primary Series [VHS]

Based on the Ashtanga practice,Yoga with Richard Freemandemonstrates successive and continuously flowing poses in the traditional method.
Freeman instructs this two-hour video with great emphasis on the sequential arrangement of each posture.
Movement, body alignment, and deep full breathing become the focus throughout each series.
These elements (breathing, movement, and alignment) aid in pulling from the core energy.
Freeman explains that the breath not only generates liveliness, but it acts as the link between mind and body.
The constant movement within this program creates an extensive challenge for the major muscles of the upper and lower body and will make even the most conditioned yoga practitioner break a sweat.
These poses are difficult and require substantial flexibility and strength, however alternative postures are offered for exercisers in need of modifications or introductory level exercise.
Seasoned practitioners will find a great workout here, while beginners may find this method somewhat unapproachable at first.
As with any exercise program, stamina and flexibility will increase as the frequency of training becomes greater.
Listening closely to Freeman's enlightening tips on the distinct practice of Ashtanga will only heighten the overall experience.
Authentic yoga terminology is used here, which makes this workout informative and effective.Yoga with Richard Freemanis a fantastic format that will continue to test the agility and strength of all yoga participants.
All exercisers will want to have a mat before starting.--Olivia Voigts

Purple

Having scored a massive hit with their debut album,Core, Stone Temple Pilots returned to the same sludge-filled well forPurple, only to come up with an album that's harder, more concise, and filled with thunderous, punishing riffs.
Headbangers will rejoice over the grinding guitars of "Meatplow," "Vasoline," "Lounge Fly," and "Unglued," but the album reveals far more than one dimension.
They back off the throttle for the hushed (though still intense) "Pretty Penny," "Big Empty" puts a respectable spin on the phrase "power ballad," and the catchy, hook-filled "Interstate Love Song" asserts itself as one of the most memorable alt-rock singles of the '90s.--Daniel Durchholz

Quicksilver

One of the group's better albums, despite coming so late in their history that it was ignored by almost everyone.
"Hope," "Fire Brothers," and "Don't Cry for My Lady Love" are among the best songs the group ever cut, and "I Found Love" is one of the prettiest, most upbeat songs ever to come from any classic San Francisco band.
Some of the rest is self-indulgent, but that's what this era of music was about -- the guitar pyrotechnics of "Song for Frisco" and "Play My Guitar" make them both more entertaining than their somewhat bland melodies; the latter song, in particular, sounds like a Marty Balin/Jefferson Airplane outtake that would have been right on target about four years before the release date of this album.
The whole record feels that way, a throwback to the psychedelic era circa late 1967.
It's also very much a folk-rock record, with a rich acoustic guitar texture on many of the songs.
For the record, since the CD reissue has no personnel information, the band at this point was Dino Valenti (guitar, vocals), Greg Elmore (drums), Gary Duncan (vocals, guitar), Mark Ryan (bass), Mark Naftalin (keyboards), and Chuck Steaks (keyboards).
If you ever wondered what the Airplane might have done as a follow-up to Surrealistic Pillow with Marty Balin still singing lead, this is it.

Lodge Seasoned Finish 10-1/2-Inch Cast Iron Round Griddle

Lodge has been making cast-iron cookware for over 100 years, and thanks to cast iron's excellent durability, some of the original pans are probably still around.
It's not hard to see why cast-iron pans are the ones most often passed down from generation to generation--nothing can dent, warp, or bend their heavy construction.
This 9-inch griddle pan will meet all grilling needs without any decrease in quality as it ages.
In fact, unlike many cooking surfaces, cast iron becomes more stick-resistant with use.
Cast iron also has excellent heat retention, so dishes don't need to be cooked over extremely high temperatures.
If you're concerned about nutrition, cast iron has been proven to safely add iron to food.
Because iron can rust, this pan should not be immersed in water for long periods and should stay out of the dishwasher.
Just wash it with soap and water, avoiding abrasive cleaners.--Laura Cuthbert

Ertl John Deere Mighty Trike

Big, simple, and strong--especially strong--are the three words that define  this tricycle.
Its all-metal construction makes it several times the weight of many  competitors, but how many of them have a warranty that reads "Ten years or 10,000  miles"?
This brute has monster-sized inflatable tires (10 inches in diameter by 3.5 inches wide  at the back, and 15 inches by almost 4 inches at the front).
The frame looks strong enough  to ride through a brick wall, and the seat--also metal, and not exactly built for comfort--adjusts  infinitely along the sloped main frame.
A simple hole-and-pin hitch at the back is perfect  for towing.
Adult assembly is required.--Richard Farr

In addition, each individual tool has been hardened in a different way to stand up to its designated use.
As with all Victorinox multi-tools, the Classic carries a lifetime warranty.About Swiss Army KnivesIn 1884, Swiss cutler Karl Elsener set up shop in Ibach-Schwyz, installing a waterwheel in Tobelbach Brook to run his grinding and polishing machines.
Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and "inox," or stainless steel.
Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives.
The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army.
Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility.

An affordable, stylish choice for recreational swimmers, the Jr. Hydrospex Goggle features a watertight fit, one-piece vinyl frame, flared lens gaskets with good coverage around the eyes, and a non-adjustable nose bridge.About SpeedoIn 1914, Speedo was founded in Australia by Alexander MacRae, a 22-year-old Scottish immigrant who arrived in the country in 1910.
The company began when MacRae Hosiery manufacturers, established by Alexander in 1914, extended the manufacture of underwear to swimwear and became MacRae Knitting Mills.
A naming competition was held by the staff in 1928 and won by a Captain Parsonson, who coined the slogan, "Speed on in your Speedos."
In 1929, the first swimsuits were in production and it didn&#x92;t take long for Speedo to successfully establish itself.
World War II caused the brand turn over 90% of it&#x92;s manufacturing to war production, providing the armed services with vital equipment such as mosquito nets.
After the war, Speedo opened a new factory and was able to re-establish itself, due to increased demand for swimsuits.
In 1951, Speedo Knitting Mills (Holdings) Ltd, was incorporated and became a publicly traded company on the Sydney Stock exchange.Speedo hit the international stage in earnest, at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, and a few years later the brand grew on a more global scale.
Export sales to the USA began and an international division was set up to monitor trade in New Zealand, Japan and South Africa.
The expansion of the brand continued, and in 1976, Speedo was appointed as the official swimwear for the 1976 Montreal Olympics, where 52 out of 54 countries wore their swimsuits.Speedo continues to make its mark in the pool and on the beach today.
Many world class athletes who wear Speedo include U.S. phenomenon Michael Phelps, legendary Australian swimmer Grant Hackett, world record holder Kosuke Kitajima from Japan, and Holland&#x92;s Inge de Bruijn.What's in the Box?Speedo Jr.Hydrospex swim goggle, printed instructionsManufacturer Warranty6-month warranty against manufacturer defect

Bushnell Yardage Pro Scout Laser Rangefinder

The Bushnell Yardage Pro Scout compact laser rangefinder can display the distance of a larger object up to 700 yds.
The monocular design provides continuous distance measurement as multiple targets in the field of view are scanned.
Battery included.
Color: Hunter Green.Hunting and golfing will never be the same with the Bushnell Yardage Pro Scout.
Its 10- to 700-yard range with 1-yard accuracy (plus or minus, without reflectors or special devices) makes it perfect for golfing, bow hunting, and archery.
The pocket-sized Pro Scout is water resistant and comes with a standard 3-volt battery.How a Laser Rangefinder WorksBushnell's Yardage Pro rangefinders use an invisible, eye-safe Class 1 Laser beam (as classified by the FDA) which is "bounced" off distant objects with the press of a button.
Then, the rangefinder's high-speed digital clock measures the time it took for a laser beam to reach a target and return to the unit.
Next, using advanced digital electronics, the rangefinder instantly calculates the distance within + / &#x96; 1 yard and shows the range in either yards or meters on a through-the-lens LCD Display.
The entire process is so fast that less than a second elapses between the time you press the button to generate a laser beam to the time the exact range to your target is displayed.Reflectivity of Target TypesBecause rangefinders "bounce" a laser beam off the target in order to take a measurement, their range is partially determined by the reflectivity of the target.
In other words, hard or "reflective" targets &#x96; like a rock cliff or semi-truck &#x96; can be measured at greater distances than soft surface targets &#x96; like a deer.
Ranges for moderately reflective targets, like trees, fall somewhere in the middle.
Most experienced hunters will use their rangefinder to frequently estimate ranges to near and distant landmarks before they actually encounter a game animal.
By "pre-measuring" ranges to spots where a trophy is likely to appear, they can concentrate on making an accurate shot when the moment of truth arrives.Through-the-lens LCD DisplayBushnell Yardage Pro rangefinders are fast and easy to use because everything you need to know is displayed on our built-in, through-the-lens LCD (Liquid Crystal Display).
Here's how it works:A.
Targeting ModesScanThe Scan mode allows you to pan across the landscape while viewing a continuously updated LCD display of the distances between you and the targets you scan with the viewfinder.RainThis feature compensates for precipitation to guarantee an accurate distance measurement through rain or snow.ZipZip allows you to accurately measure longer ranges (beyond 150 yards) when looking through foreground clutter like brush or branches.ReflectorThis feature increases the maximum measurement range for most highly reflective objects.B.

Chef's Choice 320 Diamond Hone Knife Sharpener, White

When your favorite knives start squishing ripe tomatoes instead of slicing  them, it's time to sharpen your blades.
This knife sharpener is remarkably easy to use on  both straight-edge and serrated knives.
Simply plug it in, turn it on, and feed knife blades  through the stages.
The first sharpening stage uses 100 percent diamond abrasive disks to hone the knife's edge while the second stage incorporates polymer disks to polish and strop the edge to hairsplitting sharpness.
Straight-edge knives should go through both stages, while serrated blades should only be  used in the polishing stage.The internal elastomeric spring guides hold knife blades at just the right angle to the  sharpening surfaces, making sharpening easy.
The instructions are easy to follow, and  maintenance is limited to removing the metal dust shavings from the clean-out tray once  a year or so; no lubrication is necessary for the motor, bearings, or sharpening surfaces.
Guaranteed not to detemper, the sharpener has a two-year warranty for home use.--Ariel Meadow Stallings

Lodge Original Finish 7-Quart Dutch Oven with Iron Cover

Chefs will tell you what your grandmother already knew: nothing beats cast-iron cookware for durability, conductivity, even heat distribution, and value.
Season cast iron properly and foods won't stick either--no need for a synthetic nonstick coating that might peel or crack.
Cast iron even adds iron to the nutritional content of a meal, just like your grandmother said.
Made by Lodge, one of the oldest and most trusted names in cast-iron cookware, this 7-quart Dutch oven is built like a Sherman tank, with a sturdy handle and a heavy iron lid with a textured surface for braising.
On the down side, the Dutch oven is heavier than a box full of bricks, but think of it as cookware and weaponry rolled into one.
Be sure not to use dishwashing liquid on seasoned cast iron, and towel dry and coat with a light layer of oil after washing.
Never leave cast iron sitting in water, because it will rust.
If you treat your cast-iron cookware properly, your own grandchildren will still be using it when that fancy aluminum-alloy pan is long gone to the great yuppie kitchen in the sky.--Mary Park

Coleman Two-Burner Propane Stove

Long the authority on propane camping stoves, Coleman steps up to the plate again with its two-burner PerfectFlow stove.
Coleman's PerfectFlow appliances regulate the pressure of the propane to provide a consistent cooking performance without flaring or flickering.
This steady fuel stream holds true even in cold weather, high altitudes, or when the fuel is low.This Coleman propane stove sports 2 independently adjustable 10,000 BTU burners.The stove is equipped with two 10,000 BTU burners, with independently adjustable flames that let you boil water on high (in a mere 4-1/2 minutes) while you simmer chili on low.
The fuel is long lasting as well: with just a single propane fuel cylinder (sold separately), you can use both burners on high for up to an hour--more than enough time to prepare a weekend's worth of meals.
Plus, the stove includes Coleman's Windblock side panels, which not only shields the burners for maximum heat, but also adjusts outward to accommodate larger pot sizes.
Propane stoves are perfect for almost any social outdoor activity, including camping, hunting, tailgating, and backyard cookouts.
The PerfectFlow stove measures 23.25 by 5.5 by 14.75 inches (W x H x D) when closed and carries a three-year warranty.About ColemanMore than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas.
His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America.
A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks.
He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination.
The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil.
Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a "no light, no pay" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark.In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns.
The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure.
There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more.
Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.

The company began when MacRae Hosiery manufacturers, established by Alexander in 1914, extended the manufacture of underwear to swimwear and became MacRae Knitting Mills.
A naming competition was held by the staff in 1928 and won by a Captain Parsonson, who coined the slogan, "Speed on in your Speedos."
In 1929, the first swimsuits were in production and it didn&#x92;t take long for Speedo to successfully establish itself.
World War II caused the brand turn over 90% of it&#x92;s manufacturing to war production, providing the armed services with vital equipment such as mosquito nets.
After the war, Speedo opened a new factory and was able to re-establish itself, due to increased demand for swimsuits.
In 1951, Speedo Knitting Mills (Holdings) Ltd, was incorporated and became a publicly traded company on the Sydney Stock exchange.Speedo hit the international stage in earnest, at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, and a few years later the brand grew on a more global scale.
Export sales to the USA began and an international division was set up to monitor trade in New Zealand, Japan and South Africa.
The expansion of the brand continued, and in 1976, Speedo was appointed as the official swimwear for the 1976 Montreal Olympics, where 52 out of 54 countries wore their swimsuits.Speedo continues to make its mark in the pool and on the beach today.
Many world class athletes who wear Speedo include U.S. phenomenon Michael Phelps, legendary Australian swimmer Grant Hackett, world record holder Kosuke Kitajima from Japan, and Holland&#x92;s Inge de Bruijn.What's in the Box?Speedo Hydrospex mirrored swim goggle, printed instructions

Renown internationally as a manufacturer of boxing equipment, Everlast started out as a swimwear manufacturer in 1910.
Headquartered in the Bronx, NY, the company was founded by 17-year-old Jacob Golomb.
The son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, Jacob Golomb was dissatisfied with the durability of swimsuits because they barely lasted a season, so he began making suits that he guaranteed would last for a full year.
He proudly gave them the name, Everlast.
Although the swimsuits did not last through the years, the name did.Over the next years, Golomb expanded his company into a small retail store that carried a full line of sports equipment.
In 1917, a young fighter named Jack Dempsey introduced boxing to Golomb and Everlast.
Dempsey asked Golomb to construct protective headgear that would last more than 15 rounds of intensive boxing training.
Golomb specially designed the training gear for Dempsey.
In 1919, Dempsey won the world's heavyweight championship wearing boxing gloves made for him by Golomb.
Everlast became the headquarters for boxing equipment throughout the world.
In 1925, Golomb designed elastic-waist trunks to replace the leather-belted trunks then worn by boxers.
These trunks, now known as boxer trunks, immediately became famous.
Jacob Golomb ran the business until he passed away in the early 1950s and his son, Dan, took over.
In 1958, Ben Nadorf joined Everlast and purchased 50 percent of the company from the Golomb family.
When Dan Golomb passed away in 1995, Nadorf purchased the family's remaining 50 percent interest.
Nadorf remained the president and principle share holder of Everlast until Oct. 24, 2000.Everlast men's and women's apparel and accessories continue today to be tremendously successful both inside and outside the ring.
In addition, Everlast boxing trunks and equipment remain the proud and undefeated champion of the boxing industry for more than 90 years.
The history continues, as the name states.
Everlast has a traditional past and a knockout future.

Razor Scream Machine (EA)

Basically a re-tooled Big-Wheel, the Scream Machine has flash, speed, and maneuverability, but with the control and stability younger kids need.
It has two fat, plastic rear wheels for maximum skid.
The front, though, features a large traction tire that must be inflated.
The tire is rubber because of the Scream Machine&#x92;s V-type brakes, which are operated from BMX-style, gripped handle bars.
These brakes makes it much safer--especially on downhill runs--than bikes with the foot brakes.
Leg room is adjusted by sliding  the bucket seat forward or back.
The shiny frame, with shocks, is made of high-tensile steel that won&#x92;t rust or wear out after the first year.
It has to be completely assembled by adults, however.
To that end, a detailed instruction book and tools, including a wrench and Allen screwdriver, are included.--Diane Beall

Strat-o-Matic Deluxe Baseball Revised Edition

Strat-O-Matic is the boss of sports board games, a memory-making experience.
Ideal for playing solo or in friendship-bonding face-to-face play, Strat-O-Matic is easy to learn.
Yet it is challenging enough to entertain for hours, as you make the player selections and the offensive and defensive decisions that decide the outcome.
Make your lineup and in-game strategy decisions.
Roll the dice that activate play (think of it as the pitch or swing).
Then find the result on the statistically designed player card.
Every player is unique, giving every dice roll drama.
The first die tells you whether to consult the batter or pitcher card and which of his three columns to check.
Two other six-sided dice are added to locate the result in the correct column.
What a player does most (hit for average, hit for power, strike out, etc.)
shows up on the most common dice combinations.
Because of Strat-O-Matic&#x2019;s unmatched play value, a full nine innings can be played in less than 30 minutes.
One dice roll ends most at-bats with the outcome right off the player card.
Sometimes you&#x2019;ll need a dramatic second role &#x2013; to find out if your fielder is good enough to save a run or turn a double-play, or to find out if that long fly ball is outta here or caught at the warning track.
Three games in one, Strat-O-Matic will have you playing the Basic game within minutes of opening the box.
Once you have a little experience, you may wish to adventure into the richly detailed Advanced and Super Advanced games, where lefty-righty advantages, ballpark effects, clutch hitting &#x2013; and much more &#x2013; practically put you in the dugout as a Major League manager.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs.
Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine.
With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips.Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings.
Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home.Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate.
Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise.
Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

Purple Moon Shoes

Just as Sea Monkeys are not really a bunch of tiny pink people who wear crowns and hairdos and create ersatz civilizations, so too are Moon Shoes something short of a personal trampoline experience.
Still, if you&#x92;re careful and have expectations that are somewhat earthbound, these springy little strap-on sandals can be an awful lot of fun.
Built for people age seven and up with a maximum weight of 180 pounds, the Moon Boots have adjustable bindings to fit up to a USA men&#x92;s size 9.
They are constructed of heavy duty plastic but the construction is such that the boots look likely to stay intact.
As for how high they bounce, that&#x92;s going to depend on the bouncer&#x92;s size, leg strength, and bravery.
And we would certainly recommend at least caution if not padding.--Charlie Williams

Once you start opening the knife, SOG's Patented SOG Assisted Technology, or S.A.T., takes over.
Through the balance of opposing high-tension coil springs in the knife, the force to propel the knife open becomes greater than the closing force, and the blade will open on its own.
This unique feature means that if you are using your dominant hand on another task, you can just as easily open the FSA-98 with your other hand.For security and peace of mind, S.A.T.
was developed in conjunction with a superior locking system.
The unique design of S.A.T.
knives allows them to use locking mechanisms that are stronger, more reliable, and easier to access ambidextrously than conventional liner locks.For Flash Series knives, this means the blade is held in place with a reliable piston lock that can be released quickly with a sliding button.
An additional safety lock offers extra security when the blade is closed.
For easy reference, the lock switch shows red when the knife is ready to open.Cryogenic Heat Treatment for Sharp, Dependable BladesOf course the workhorse of any knife is the cutting surface, and FSA-98 offers a full, 3.5-inch, half-serrated blade with an elegant satin finish.SOG's proprietary Cryogenic Heat Treatment process ensures that this blade will stay sharp over the long haul.
This intensive process takes more than 48 hours and involves slowly bringing the blade's temperature down to less than -300 degrees Fahrenheit, then bringing it slowly back to room temperature.
The stress created through this process relieves the material on an atomic level and increases overall strength and edge retention.Elegant, Ergonomic Design for Ease of UseEven if your blade is sharp, it's hard to make the cuts you want if a knife doesn't sit comfortably in your hand.
That's why the handle on this knife features a unique, ergonomic contour.
Crafted from tough, glass-reinforced Zytel, the handle helps ensure that your knife is both durable and well-balanced.
And it is lightly textured to prevent slippage.At just 3.1 ounces, this folding knife is lightweight and easy to carry.
A reversible, bayonet-mounted clip extends from the back of the handle, allowing the knife to sit low in your pocket for the most discreet carry possible.This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in workmanship and materials.About SOG: Strong, Innovative, Specialty ToolsSOG originally stood for Studies and Observation Group, an elite joint services military group designed to handle covert operations during the Vietnam War.
SOG Specialty Knives was founded in the spirit of this elite group and became the first knife manufacturer to offer an expanded line that included fixed blades, folding knives, and multipurpose tools.Each SOG product is created by company Founder and Chief Engineer, Spencer Frazer.

Lodge L9OG3 Pre-Seasoned Cast-Iron Round Griddle, 10.5-inch

The Lodge Cast Iron 10.5-inch Griddle is a multi-functional cookware that works wonders with all your favorite foods.
This griddle is essential for big breakfasts, tortillas, quesadillas, roasted vegetables and grilled sandwiches.
Cast iron loves a campfire, a stovetop, or an oven, and can slow-cook foods without scorching.
It retains heat well so you can sear meat at higher temperatures and will keep your delicious meals warm for a long time.
Whether used in a kitchen or camp, theses virtually indestructible cookware should last for generations.
Made of cast iron, this griddle evenly distributes heat from the bottom through the sidewalls.
Sporting a stylish black color, the cast iron cookware looks good in most kitchens and it doubles up as an excellent source of nutritional iron.
This pre-seasoned griddle is ready-to-use right out of the box.
While the cookware comes pre-seasoned to prevent food from sticking, it works best when sprayed or lightly coated with vegetable oil before use.
The Lodge seasoning procedure is a multiple-step process in which the seasoning oil is applied via an electrostatic spray system that coats the cookware, then it&#x2019;s baked in commercial ovens at very high temperatures.
This allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the pores of the iron.
This seasoning process achieves a seasoned finish that would take many months of home use to achieve.
Sometimes during this process, the seasoning oil can collect and create a bubble or slight drip at the bottom of the pan as it&#x2019;s hanging through the production process.
And that in turn can turn brown as it&#x2019;s processed through the seasoning ovens.
&#xA0;This brown spot is not rust but in fact, carbonized seasoning and will darken with use.
&#xA0;The factory seasoning process makes Lodge cast iron products ready to use right out of the box, and the product over time &#x201C;Just keeps getting better&#x201D;.
After cooking, clean with a stiff nylon brush and hot water.
Using soap is not recommended, and harsh detergents should never be used.
Towel dry immediately and apply a light coating of oil to utensil while it is still warm.
Cast Iron, like your grandmother used, still ranks as one of the best cooking utensils ever made.
It gives you a nearly non-stick surface, without the possible harmful fumes generated by preheating chemically treated nonstick cookware.
The American-based company, Lodge, has been fine-tuning its construction of rugged, cast-iron cookware for more than a century.
Measures 10.5-inches diameter and .5-inches deep

Ever try hitting an opponent with a ball of air?

For example: 4x40.
The first number is the power or magnification of the scope.
With a "4x", the object being viewed appears to be four times closer than when seen with the unaided eye.Objective Lens Size: The second number in the formula (4x40) is the diameter of the objective or front lens.
The larger the objective lens, the more light that enters the scope, and the brighter the image.Field of View (F.O.V.
): The side-to-side measurement of the circular viewing field or subject area.
It is defined by the width in feet or meters of the area visible at 1000 yards or meters.
A wide angle binocular features a wide field of view and is better for following action.
Generally, the higher the magnification, the narrower the field of view.Reticle: A reticle is the crosshair or pattern placed in the eyepiece of the scope which establishes the gun's position on the target.

Sevylor Motor Mount

Paddling a boat can be fun, but it can also be exhausting after a few hours on the water.
Enter the Sevylor motor mount, which makes it easy to attach a gasoline motor to your Sevylor boat.
The motor mount is easy to install, with a pair of secure  arms that fit inside a Sevylor's attachment points.
More importantly, the mount works with all gas-motor-compatible Sevylor boats manufactured over the past 40 years.About SevylorThe road from Sevylor's founding in 1948 to its current role as the dominant supplier of a wide range of inflatables--such as kayaks, boats, and towables--is a long one, with plenty of original inventions and innovations along the way.
Established in a city suburb of Vitry, France, by electronics engineer Berco Grimbert, Sevylor originally built electrical accessories, with a sideline business dedicated to using its high-frequency welding machines to manufacture PVC consumer goods.
The first inflatable to receive rave notice was a small bathtub called the Dou Dou.
Perfect for postwar France, the inflatable tub was portable, convenient, practical, easy to clean, durable, and, best of all, affordable.
After moving to the picturesque Alsatian village of Buhl, the company expanded into developing valves, pumps, boats, inflatable pools, and a variety of water toys.
In the ensuing years, Sevylor first developed a PVC that had "memory"--meaning it could return to its original shape regardless of temperature--and then made history by releasing an inflatable pool mattress with a headrest and circular pockets.
In 1986, the company invented the Ski Bob, a real turning point in the evolution of the towables business.
Today, Sevylor's innovative designs include tenders, hunting and fishing boats, specialty boats and kayaks, towables, snow tubes, air beds, pool floats, river tubes, swim and sport rings, and more.

Victorinox Swisscard Lite, Ruby

From the renowned company that created the Swiss Army Knife a century ago comes the SwissCard Lite, an ultra-thin multi-tool that's an ideal tag-along accessory for users everywhere.
The SwissCard Lite is roughly the size of a credit card, so you can easily fit it in your wallet or pocket.
However, the SwissCard Lite performs a ton of tasks that your AmEx card can't, with such tools as a letter opener, a small set of scissors, a pair of tweezers, a straight pin, a pressurized ballpoint pen, and a magnifying glass.
And that's just the beginning, as the device also includes such fix-it tools as 3mm and 5mm flat-head screwdrivers, two Phillips screwdrivers, an LED mini light, and a ruler that measures items in both inches and centimeters.
In short, there's no better multi-tool for people who find traditional Swiss Army Knives a little bulky.
The SwissCard Lite, which measures 3.25 inches long, carries the Victorinox lifetime warranty.About VictorinoxIn 1884, Swiss cutler Karl Elsener set up shop in Ibach-Schwyz, installing a waterwheel in Tobelbach Brook to run his grinding and polishing machines.
Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and "inox," or stainless steel.
Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives.
The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army.
Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility.

Safariland Horizontal Concealment Magazine Holster T0021

This is the answer, but first let me describe the problem.
You want to carry a Leatherman, a folding knife, even a spare handgun magazine with you at all times.
It can't be in your pocket because it's in the way.
The clip knives are great but the clip wears at your pants and is unsightly, if not plain ugly.
And speaking of ugly, the Leatherman case that comes with the Leatherman is the worst.
Not to mention, that they also get in your way when sitting and bending over.
So, what is the answer?
The Horizontal Concealment Sheath.
It was first developed to carry and conceal spare handgun magazines.
But then, being ingenious, we developed a sheath for the Leatherman and for most pocket knives.
It's perfect for Spyderco, Benchmade and other folding knives.
Plus, great for magazines!
* Single magazine holder- carries magazines in a horizontal position * Hook-and-loop belt attachment wraps around belt * Hook-and-loop flap keeps the magazine in the pouch * Available in Plain Black finish

Coleman Taos Extreme-Weather Mummy Bag

Stay warm and comfortable on a chilly fall evening with the Coleman Taos mummy sleeping bag.
The Taos, which offers a temperature rating down to 25 degrees F, is filled with 38 ounces of Coletherm insulation.
This allows for a greater loft--a measure of the amount of space the insulation occupies and the amount of air the insulation can trap.
The bag also offers several other features to fight the chill, including a double-batt, offset quilt construction that eliminates potential cold spots, a semi-sculpted hood that surrounds the head with warmth, and a full-length, insulated draft tube that locks out drafts.
And to help the bag last through the years, Coleman added a durable polyester and diamond ripstop cover that resists tears.Coleman's ComfortSmart technology includes such features as a ThermoLock zipper, FiberLocked insulation, and a ZipPlow tool.Coleman's ComfortSmart TechnologyThe best way to relax after a big day of camping adventures is to wrap up in a warm sleeping bag and drift off to peaceful sleep.
Coleman is so committed to making sure you have reliable and cozy bedding that it backs its Taos sleeping bag with its ComfortSmart guarantee--a promise that the bag will deliver all-night comfort.
Coleman can make this promise thanks to its third-party, scientifically tested temperature ratings; engineering features that promote thermal efficiency and durability; and the creation of different bag sizes to ensure a comfortable fit.Coleman developed a number of warmth-enhancing features for its ComfortSmart system.
The FiberLock insulation tailoring, for example, is designed to prevent insulation from shifting in the bag and developing thin or cold spots.
By keeping the insulation in place, Coleman also lengthens the life of the bag.
The ThermoLock feature contributes by reducing heat loss (and cold seepage) through zipper coils.
This sets up an additional insulating barrier to stand guard along the length of the zipper, ensuring that the snug feeling campers get when zipping up the bag stays with them through the night.
Coleman also added such features as a ZipPlow zipper tool, which prevents zipper snags by channeling fabric away from the zipper coils, and Zipper Glide tailoring, which makes it silky smooth to zip the bag at the corners.SizingThe Taos is a tall sleeping bag, with dimensions of 82 by 32 inches.
As a result, the bag fits most people up to 6 feet 2 inches tall.
And despite the mummy bag construction, Coleman added a box-foot silhouette to give your feet extra wiggle room.Also equipped with a two-way zipper for maximum ventilation, the Taos comes with a stuff sack and carries a five-year warranty.About ColemanMore than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas.
His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America.
A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks.
He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination.
The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil.
Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a "no light, no pay" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark.In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns.
The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure.
There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more.
Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.Amazon.com Sleeping Bag GuideSleep Well: Finding the Right Sleeping BagSleeping bag technology has come a long way from the days of cowboy bedrolls.
These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings.
Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag:Buy for ColdIt's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly.
That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips.
For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees F or higher will likely do the trick.
If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35 degrees F. Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 degrees F range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10 degrees F.Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth.
Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep.
If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated 10 degrees colder.
The opposite is true for "warm" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night.Goose or No Goose?The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material.
Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic.
While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios.
While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light.
There's a reason why geese can flyandstay warm through the winter.
Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use.All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market, and synthetic materials are getting better all the time.
While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet.
(Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.)
If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone.
Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down, while synthetic bags are non-allergenic.
Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget.Bags for All ShapesSleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use.
Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours.
This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature.
Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well.
Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space.
Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips.Pad YourselfNo matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory.
Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you.

As a fundamental form of aerobic training, walking has numerous physical benefits for the heart, lungs, and circulatory system, while also increasing muscle tone and burning fat calories.
Treadmills provide a convenient way to regularly exercise in all weather conditions in the comfort and safety of your own home.From beginners just starting an exercise regimen to advanced athletes looking to maintain their fitness level, anyone interested in getting and staying in shape can benefit greatly from regular use of a treadmill.
Treadmills allow you to determine the pace, distance, and complexity of the workout based on your needs, all while watching television, talking on the telephone, or reading a magazine.
Much easier on sensitive joints like the knees and hips, treadmill walking and running surfaces are typically long, padded platforms that allow ample room for a long stride and comfortable, low-impact walk or jog without the harsh contact of a concrete surface.While many different types, styles, and price ranges of treadmills exist, many of them offer unique features like a fold-up design for easy storage, an electronic display monitor showing speed, distance, workout time, incline level, and burned calories, and EKG grip pulses to monitor the heart rate while exercising.
Regardless of the simple to complex features you may choose, treadmills offer an array of aerobic exercise opportunities that will provide long-lasting beneficial cardiovascular results without a commute to the gym or a jog in the rain.

Canon 12x36 Image Stabilization II Binoculars w/Case, Neck Strap &amp; Batteries

Amazon.com Product Description Canon's 12x36 Image Stabilization II binoculars incorporate an optical image stabilizer for shake-free viewing with minimal eye fatigue.
This technology was first developed for Canon video camcorders and is now available in many of Canon's binoculars.
The system employs a Vari-Angle Prism, dual transparent plates, independent vertical and horizontal sensors, and a dedicated microprocessor to continuously adjust the prism to maintain a steady image.These 12x36 Image Stabilization II binoculars feature a water-resistant rubber coating for nonslip holding.
If you get caught in light rain, you don't have to worry about the optics fogging up or getting ruined.
These binoculars deliver high magnification, long eye relief, and wide-field viewing.
Controls for focusing and image stabilization are centrally located and are accessible by both hands.Improvements to the objective lens assembly have resulted in the binoculars being approximately 26% lighter and 10% smaller than the previous 12x36 IS model they replace.
And reductions in power consumption mean a massive 270% increase in battery life of up to four hours using two AA-size alkaline batteries.Image Stabilization and MoreWith any high magnification binoculars, most users will experience frustrating image shake.
Unless fixed to a tripod, image shake can render high magnification binoculars useless.
Canon's IS technology is remarkably effective at eliminating this problem and is widely used by the television industry with Canon's professional broadcast quality video recording equipment.
A special VAP (Vari-Angle Prism) corrective IS system sits between the objective lens group and the porro prism on each side of the binoculars.
Within thousandths of a second of the binoculars being moved from their optical axis by vibrations, a detection system activates the IS mechanism.
The VAP shape alters to refract or 'bend' the light path by precisely the right amount, thus fully compensating for the vibration.
It is this essentially immediate response that effectively suppresses image shake.
The binoculars' compact design is based on Canon's popular 10x30 IS model.
Curved surfaces mean easy handling, while nature lovers will appreciate the low-reflectance exterior and low gloss front covers, which help to avoid disturbing birds and otherWhat do the numbers mean?15x50?
8x25?
The two numbers used to describe any pair of binoculars are their magnification &mdash; 8x, 12x, 15x and so on &mdash; and the diameter of their objective lenses &mdash; 25mm, 36mm, 50mm, and so on.
The larger the first number is, the larger the object will appear to be in the objective lens.
For instance, if you use a 10x lens and look at an object that is 100 yards away, it appears to be the same size as an object located just 10 yards away.
The second number, the size of the objective lens, is important because the larger the objective lens, the more light it can admit for brighter, more detailed images, and the better suited they will be for lowlight situations.A look inside

An additional safety lock offers extra security when the blade is closed, and for easy reference, the lock switch shows red when the knife is ready to be opened.Cryogenic Heat Treatment Guarantees a Sharp, Durable BladeThe TF-3 offers a full, 3.75-inch, AUS8 stainless steel blade that has undergone SOG's patented Cryogenic Heat Treatment process, which ensures that this blade will stay sharp over the long haul.
This intensive process takes more than 48 hours and involves slowly reducing the blade's temperature to less than -300 degrees Fahrenheit, then slowly heating the blade to room temperature.
The stress created by this process strengthens the steel on an atomic level and increases the blade's overall durability and edge retention.In addition to having undergone the Cryogenic Heat Treatment Process, this knife is treated with a tiger-stripe coating that provides reduced reflectivity and added camouflage.Ergonomic, Lightweight Design Ensures Comfortable UseEven if your blade is sharp, it's hard to make precise cuts if your knife doesn't fit comfortably in your hand.
That's why this knife's handle is ergonomically contoured.
Crafted from tough, glass-reinforced Zytel, the handle is well-balanced and features SOG's unique Digi-Grip texturing, a feature that gives you gripping power where you need it most.
Additionally, the grooved handle allows you to cut heavy cord and cable without having to open the blade.At just 3.6 ounces, this folding knife is lightweight and easy to carry.
A reversible, bayonet-mounted clip extends from the back of the handle, allowing the knife to sit low in your pocket for the most discreet carry possible.
The removable clip is easily switched for right/left hand-carry.This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in manufacturing and materials.About SOG: Strong, Innovative Specialty ToolsSOG originally stood for Studies and Observation Group, an elite joint services military group designed to handle covert operations during the Vietnam War.
SOG Specialty Knives &amp; Tools was founded in the spirit of this elite group and became the first knife manufacturer to offer an expanded line that included fixed blades, folding knives, and multipurpose tools.Each SOG product is created by company Founder and Chief Engineer, Spencer Frazer.
Known for their uncompromising style and performance, these knives and tools showcase innovation, dependability, and a unique, futuristic style that has garnered awards and recognition worldwide.

Lodge Enamel Cast-Iron 7-Quart Dutch Oven, Liberty Blue

Lodge Enamel is the more upscale of the two enameled cast iron lines from this respected American cast iron cookware company.
Sleeker and more contemporary in form than Lodge Color enameled cast iron, and featuring a stylish L-shaped lid knob made of stainless-steel, Lodge Enamel cast iron cookware is coated with four, not two, glossy coats of hard-as-nails porcelain enamel that is imported from France.
The exterior color is uniform, not gradated, and is nicely set off by a cream interior.
The lid is oven-safe up to 500 degrees F, so you can start a stew or casserole on the stovetop and finish by baking it in the oven.
The 7-quart Dutch oven measures 11-3/8 inches in diameter and 5 inches deep, perfect for slow-simmering stews, casseroles, and chicken-and-rice dishes.Lodge enameled cast iron makes a smart choice due to its versatility-you can marinate raw meats in it, since it won't absorb odors or flavors, and you can braise, saut&#xE9;, simmer, and bake in it.
Made in China to Lodge's meticulous specifications, each cookware item is first clad in matte black enamel before the color is added.
The black rim that shows on the oven is actually the scratch-resistant matte enamel, not the raw cast iron.
Though the Dutch oven is dishwasher-safe, washing by hand is recommended to best preserve the glossy finish.
Look also for the less expensive, more traditionally styled Lodge Color series, in a different set of colors and sizes to suit any kitchen.
All Lodge enameled ware is covered by a lifetime warranty against defects.--Ann Bieri

Flybar 1200

Engaging the ThrustersThe patented Flybar 1200 spring system consists of 12 independent rubber thrusters.
Each one is capable of storing up to 100 pounds of thrust when stretched to full extension (300%).
Multiply that by 12 and that puts up to 1,200 pounds of thrust under you.
(You didn't think the model number was coincidental, did you?)
That's enough to get a 170-pound rider over 5 feet of elevation.
Engaging thrusters is quick and easy and can be done with the outer shell on or off.
Adjusting the number of thrusters will change the feel of the spring from soggy to stiff and can be used to limit the bouncing height of the Flybar for beginners.
Adjustability is also how the Flybar is capable of accommodating such a wide range of rider weights.
To start we recommend engaging one thruster for every 20 pounds of rider weight using a minimum of four at any time.Flight control: The Flybar 1200's internals can be adjusted for the bouncer's weight and desire for airtime.To engage a thruster, just use the included tool (that niftily stows in the Flybar's protective top cap) to lift the T-shaped hanger up and into its cradle in the upper mount.
Disengaging is just the opposite.
The slots on the Flybar outer shell allow you to do this without taking the Flybar apart.
In under 30 seconds the Flybar can be adjusted to the appropriate spring setting and passed from a 120-pound rider to a 250-pound rider.Powering the PistonsAnother great feature of the Flybar 1200 is piston height adjustability.
The piston is easily adjusted via two bolts and a safety pin.
This also can be done from inside or outside the Flybar outer shell.
Just learning how to use the Flybar?
Set the piston to 11 inches; it will limit your bounce height and make it easier to balance on the footpegs.
Well practiced and ready for some airtime?
Set the piston to the full 18 inches, jump onto the footpegs, and enjoy the view.How It All BeganSince his first boyhood bounces on a pogo stick, pro skateboarder Andy Macdonald had a passion for the elevation, exhilaration, and pure fun that the pogo offered.
Even though Andy went on to become the world's top-ranked skateboarder (a title he still holds today), he never lost the desire to revisit that rush he knew as a young boy on his pogo.
However, no product substantial enough to support the weight, strength, and demands of a world-class athlete existed.
So in the summer of 2000, Andy embarked on an effort to find a manufacturing partner that could deliver on his vision for this next-generation product.Pro skateboarder Andy Macdonald's boyhood dream leaps into reality.Irwin Arginsky, president of SBI Enterprises, had shared that same vision and goal but for an even longer time.
SBI Enterprises has been manufacturing pogo sticks since 1918 and developed a reputation as the industry leader.
In fact, the company is the original holder of the Hansburg Pogo patents.
Although SBI experienced steady success over the years, Mr. Arginsky continually searched for an opportunity to develop a product that would bring the "excitement of elevation" to a new level.It was this common quest for a product that could elevate adults as well as children to new levels and in new ways that ultimately led to the unlikely partnership between Andy Macdonald and SBI Enterprises.After countless meetings and false leads, Macdonald was about to abandon his quest, frustrated by the futility of his efforts to find a sporting goods manufacturer willing and able to develop this new product--until August 10, 2001.
On that date, Macdonald spotted a story in The Wall Street Journal on the fad of newfangled pogos on the market, ones that included bells and whistles but lacked any new technology or capabilities.
SBI's Irwin Arginsky was quoted in the article, making reference to a new technology that would revolutionize the concept of bouncing.
Arginsky's goal: To create a new product category--not just a new fad.Enjoy the view!Macdonald quickly contacted Arginsky, who eagerly offered to share the beta prototype of a patented elastomeric spring system that was mobile like a pogo and could clear heights of over 5 feet, with a bounce that felt like a trampoline.
After testing the system in a secret meeting with Arginsky in the shadow of the 2001 Gravity Games, Macdonald was convinced this was the real deal.
A partnership was born as the two businessmen and visionaries agreed to collaborate in developing and marketing the product known today as the Flybar 1200 model.
But there was much work to be done.With the market flooded at the time with pogo sticks that made promises they could not deliver, this team knew their product had to withstand the skeptics and truly earn respect.
For three years, SBI and its development team of engineers, designers, and manufacturing experts collaborated with Macdonald to translate the patented system into a product capable of mass production and that met the exacting demands of Macdonald and Arginsky.
After investing more than a million dollars and innumerable labor-hours, testing multiple prototypes, and resisting temptations to rush to market, the Flybar 1200--the first of several models planned for production--is now available.

The company's roots trace back to the late 1870s in Plymouth, Michigan, the result of a collaboration between the Plymouth Iron Windmill Company and Plymouth Air Rifle Company.
Company founder, watchmaker, and inventor Clarence Hamilton developed an all-metal air gun of his own design, which was originally a bonus item sold to every farmer who purchased a windmill.
When Hamilton presented his prototype to the company's board of directors for examination, General Manager L.C.
Hough test fired the weapon and exclaimed, in a popular colloquialism of the time, "Boy!
That's a daisy!"
So that's what they named the gun.By 1895, sales and popularity of the Daisy had grown so rapidly, the company ceased manufacturing windmills, focused exclusively on producing air guns, and changed its name to Daisy Manufacturing Company.
The company has continued to grow over time -- adding models like the renowned Red Ryder, innovative new PowerLine products for advanced shooters, Avanti guns for match competition, and a Winchester-branded line -- and is now based in Rogers, Arkansas.

Spyderco Native Lightweight Plain Edge Knife, Black

The Spyderco Native compact folding knife is engineered for the human hand with an ergonomic design that maximizes cutting ability while minimizing discomfort and fatigue.
The knife features a hollow-ground, plain-edge, drop-point blade of premium CPM-S30V stainless steel for superior edge retention and strength.
The drop-point shape of the blade enables precise puncture cuts and clean slicing.
A swedge ground from the spine reduces weight while a section of non-sharpened serrations line the blade's spine yield an additional slip resistant point for the thumb.Specifically developed to combine performance and comfort, Spyderco designers paid close attention to the knife the handle when creating the Native.
The knife handle is made of strong and lightweight injection-molded fiberglass-reinforced-nylon (FRN).
Two separate finger choils are built in for maximum versatility during use--the first choil (where the blade and handle meet) allows the index finger to be positioned closer to the edge for precise, controlled cutting--the second choil positions the hand farther back for increased power and comfort.
Meanwhile, Bi-Directional Texturing molded into the FRN handle creates a multi-level texture for a positive grip.
Carved out of the back lock mechanism is a David Boyle Dent that insures the lock will remain safely engaged even when gripping the handle forcefully.
Finally, a black steel pocket clip offers tip-up carry and can be reversed for left or right-side carry via a barrel-shaped screw that doubles as a lanyard hole.Back Lock MechanismPositioned on the spine of the handle, the back lock uses a rocker arm which pivots in the center.
A protrusion on one end of the arm connects with a notch on the blade&#xFFFD;s tang locking the blade open.Bi-Directional TexturingA patented texture pattern is molded into the FRN handle with forward and backward graduating steps radiating outward from the center of the handle to provide slip resistance.Spyderco Round Holeone-hand openingAnd, like all Spyderco knives, the Native carries a lifetime warranty to be free of defects in materials and workmanship.Key Features:Ambidextrous tip-up clipWeight reducing spine swedge-grindSpine jimping--small texturing on the spine of the blade create tactile resistance for purchase, traction, and slip-resistanceHollow-ground plain edge bladeBoyle DentLanyard HoleBack LockSpecificationsOverall length: 7 inchesLength closed: 3.938 inchesBlade length: 3.125 inchesCutting edge: 2.625 inchesBlade thickness: 0.125 inchesHole diameter: 0.469 inchesBlade steel: CPM-S30VHandle material:  FRN Bi-Directional TexturedWeight: 2.65 ounces

DMT DS2E 12-Inch Diamond Steel Sharpening Rod, Extra Fine Grit

For professionals and home cooks who are confident in their technique, this sharpening rod is a quick and effective way to hone and gently realign the folded-over edge of a knife blade.
The rod's surface is coated with diamond dust, the hardest and most abrasive material for honing knives, requiring only a few strokes with light pressure while holding the blade at a 20-degree angle.
The extra-fine grit on this rod is appropriate for frequent touch-ups or as a final honing step to polish an edge that has already been sharpened on a coarser grit.
A steel should always be longer than the blade it is honing and, at 12 inches long, this diamond sharpening rod can be used to maintain all kitchen knives.
The steel has a sanitary black plastic handle with a guard to protect hands.
Its pointed end affixes into a cutting board to hold the rod still for honing and has a rubber cap that safely covers the point when the rod in-between uses.
There is a color-coded ring at the end for hanging the steel up and also for quickly identifying the grit size among a collection of DMT sharpeners of varying grits.
DMT generously vows to replace any product found to be defective free of charge.--Cristina Vaamonde

Thule 544 Lock Cylinders for Car Racks (4-Pack)

These four rugged cylinder locks provide security for Thule car racks and accessories to deter theft.
They come with a limited lifetime warranty against defects.About ThuleTo say that Thule&#x92;s beginnings in the U.S. were humble would be an understatement.
Founding member Ake Skeppner sold products at windsurf competitions on the New England shoreline, exhibited the product line at a number of different trade shows, and even canvassed local retailers in the greater New York area, all from his "office"--a now-famous station wagon.
Initial success was found in the small but growing sport of windsurfing where a strong, reliable roof rack was an indispensable piece of equipment.
This was quickly followed by success in the ski business where Thule's Swedish heritage certainly helped the product gain rapid acceptance.By the mid-1980s, the company sold products directly to ski and windsurfing shops but sold through distributors to address the large and growing bike business.
A risky decision was made to terminate these distributor relationships and sell direct to retailers through a network of independent sales representatives.
Much of the company's market success today can be traced to that decision.
Shortly after, Ake hired an engineer and set up a small assembly plant in Elmsford, New York in order to design and manufacture bike carriers that would offer the features demanded by the U.S. consumer and compete effectively with other racks on the market.The company has since grown rapidly through product innovation, a commitment to quality, and the continuance of a strong entrepreneurial spirit as well as continuing to evolve their products to meet the needs of users.

M16A1 Airsoft Rifle

A 1:1 scale replica of an M-16A1 rifle, this airsoft rifle is remarkably authentic.
The airsoft rifle fires round pellets known as BBs, which are propelled out of the gun by compressed air.
The advantage of the airsoft rifle, however, is that players can safely train, simulate, or play with the gun without fearing serious injury.
The airsoft rifle looks, feels, weighs, and functions just like a real firearm, but is built for casual recreation rather than weaponized use.
In fact, the only way you can typically tell a real-steel firearm from an airsoft rifle is the blazing orange tip and the BBs that fire when you pull the trigger.
The rifle comes complete with 1,000 BBs, safety goggles, a rifle strap, and a BB quick-loading tube.Specifications:Velocity: Approximately 290 fps with 0.12-gram BBs, 240 fps with 0.2-gram BBsRange: 130 feet effective, 160 feet maximumCapacity: 65 roundsBarrel length: 11-1/2 inchesDimensions: 39 inches long, 10-1/4 inches tallWeight: 3 pounds

The hard-working Columbia Bahama II men's long-sleeve shirt keeps you comfortable long after you've brought in your limit.
Designed specifically for the needs of anglers, the shirt is made of a lightweight, durable nylon fabric that dries fast should you get splashed.
The mesh-lined cape vents at the back shoulder, meanwhile, enhance the airflow, helping keep you cool in the hottest conditions.
Finally, the shirt offers built-in Omni-Shade UV protection that keeps the sun off your back until you're ready to come inside.
Other features include two big chest pockets that offer plenty of room for small gear, button tabs for rolling up and securing the long sleeves, and your choice of several sizes and colors.The Bahama II long-sleeve shirt includes mesh-lined cape vents at the shoulder to enhance the airflow.About Omni-Shade TechnologyColumbia's Omni-Shade clothing protects you from damaging UV radiation by blocking the majority of the sun's harmful rays, letting you stay out longer on sunny days.
Unlike SPF (Sun Protection Factor)--which is a measure of sunburn reduction from sunblock and protects you from UVA rays--Columbia's Omni-Shade products are far more versatile, combining a tight-weave construction, UV reflectors, and UV absorbing technology.
These features not only prevent sunburns and long-term skin damage, but they also protect the wearer from UVB rays in addition to UVA rays.
UVB rays are much more harmful than UVA, and are present even on cloudy days.
Plus, Omni-Shade doesn't wear off.
Instead, your safety increases as the Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) increases.
Several layers of Omni-Shade protection are available: UPF 15, UPF 30, UPF 40, and UPF 50-plus.
It's like sunscreen, but you don't have to reapply.
All Omni-Shade fabric carries the Skin Cancer Foundation's Seal of Recommendation, which is given to sun-protective fabrics that have a minimum UPF of 30.Specifications:Construction: 100-percent nylon Backcountry clothOmni-Shade sun protection: UPF 30Quick dry: YesVented: YesRod holder: YesAbout Columbia SportswearFounded in 1938, Columbia Sportswear Company has grown from a small family-owned hat distributor to one of the world's largest outerwear brands and the leading seller of skiwear in the United States.
Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories.
Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value.
Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company.Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937.
They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city.
Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves.
In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company.
When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior.
After that it wasn't long before business really started to take off.
Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric.
They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options.
In the early 1980s, then 60 year-old Gert began her role as "Mother Boyle" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign.The company went public in 1998 and moved into a new era as a world leader in the active outdoor apparel industry.
Today, Columbia Sportswear employs more than 1,800 people around the world and distributes and sells products in more than 50 countries and to more than 12,000 retailers internationally.

Yukon 6-100X100 Angled Eye Spotting Scope Kit

The Yukon 6-100x100 is an innovative spotting scope that provides a high quality image at magnifications ranging from six to 100X.
For low magnification observation, the device utilizes a 25-millimeter lens.
Linear zooming allows magnification adjustments between six and 25X, but when a higher magnification is desired, the flip of a switch shifts the light path from one lens to the other.
With the 100-millimeter objective lens, zooming capabilities increase to 25 to 100X magnification.
The light gathering capability of the 100-millimeter lens creates a bright, clear picture in nearly all viewing conditions, including twilight.When you pair the scope with a Digital Camera Adapter (sold separately), you can transform it into a high-powered photographic unit.To prevent viewing fatigue or discomfort, an adjustable 45-degree, rotating eyepiece can suit the viewer's position from any angle, even when lying on the ground.
Both digital and photo camera adapters are available to turn the scope into a high-powered photographic tool, and it can accommodate both photographic and spotting scope tripods, or double as a telescope for late night stargazing.FeaturesDual objective lenses with a folded light path for compact size and light weight6-to-100X zoom variable magnificationDigital camera adaptable with optional accessoryEyepiece rotates 90 degrees for viewing from any angleLightweight with both 25-millimeter and 100-millimeter objective lensesIncluded Accessories100X Table Top TripodProtective carrying caseObjective lens coversSun shieldLifetime WarrantyThis Yukon Optics product includes a limited lifetime manufacturer's warranty against defects in materials and workmanship.

Purple Haze

Cam'ron's records command admiration from a wide spectrum of hip-hoppers: conscious to crunk to gangsta.
Cam and his Dipset stick to the same production formula (on "Get Down," for example) that graced his previous monster hit, "Oh Boy": sped-up samples and lots of hooks.
Therefore, it seems only natural that he would team up withKanye West--another rap duke who's taken this style to the bank--and on "Dip-Set Forever" and "Down and Out" they share sped-up samples together.
But if drugs (using, selling, or importing) and sexploits aren't your thing,Purple Hazemay come off a bit lyrically linear.
Cam'ron also plunders pop-culture samples ranging from theHill Street BluesTV theme ("Harlem Streets") toCyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Want to Fun" ("Girls"), often to questionable effect.
"Adrenaline," however, teams two MCs with the freakiest flows on the planet,Twistaand Psycho Drama, to produce menacing, low-BPM G-funk at its finest.--Dalton Higgins

Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and "inox," or stainless steel.
Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives.
The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army.
Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility.

Kettler Sprint Balance Bike (Original)

When it comes time to teach your child to ride a bike, there's no better or safer way than the Kettler Sprint Balance training bike.
Recommended for children between the ages of 2 and 6 years, the Sprint Balance features a Euro-styled low step-through frame design that won't get in your kid's way, along with a height-adjustable, extra-long saddle with a generous padding for comfort.

At the same time, the Sprint Balance's patented limited turn radius helps prevent tipping, so Xander won't careen out of control while making his first few turns.
Other safety features include Euro-styled wheel and spoke covers (no shoelace tangles here) and 12-inch tubeless air tires with an extra-wide tread.
The Sprint Balance, which offers a maximum weight of 100 pounds, is backed by a three-year warranty.

Packed with ten handy implements, the Winchester multi-tool from Gerber slices oranges, drives screws, cuts wires, clamps down on work pieces, and opens refreshments on the fly.
The Winchester is constructed of surgical stainless steel for optimal durability and corrosion resistance.
Handsomely-stained, wood handles smack of heirloom quality and are ergonomically designed to ensure comfort and control.
Implements snap crisply into place for steadfast performance and safety.Now for the guts: The tool&#x92;s stainless steel needle nose pliers are precisely forged with jaws perfectly aligned, so their full surface areas make contact with work pieces offering optimal gripping power.
The pliers have integrated wire cutters for flush cuts through a wide variety of gauges.
A fine-edge blade with a pinpoint tip, uncommon in most multi-tools, ensures long-lasting sharpness and is great for detailed cutting applications.
Where most multi-tool drivers tend to loosen up over time, the Winchester&#x92;s cross-head screwdriver stands up to plenty of torque for driving larger screws.
A medium-size, flathead screwdriver with bottle opener easily cracks open refreshments on the go.
As though these fine implements weren&#x92;t enough, the Winchester also includes: a serrated knife, a large flat head screwdriver, a can opener, a small flat head screwdriver, and an awl with a file&#x97;an impressive array that&#x92;d normally require packing along a second multi-tool, but one that&#x92;s organized and easily accessible with this single, lightweight unit.--Brian D.

Everlast Pro Style Training Gloves

If you want to fight like a pro, you have to train like a pro.
Enter the Everlast Pro Style training gloves, which help you train properly every time you step up to the bag.
Made of synthetic leather, the Pro Style gloves are built to promote proper punching technique, with full padding on the front and back of the wrist that conforms to the natural shape of your fist.
As a result, the gloves not only teach your hands how to punch correctly, but they also prevent injury.
This dense two-layer foam sandwich also protects your wrists, as does the exclusive ThumbLok feature, which keeps your thumb and fist positioned correctly.
Perhaps best of all, the gloves are designed using EverFresh materials.
Available in 12-, 14, and 16-ounce sizes, the gloves offer the choice of a traditional lace-up design or a hook-and-loop Velcro strap for quick on and off.About EverlastAlthough the name Everlast is synonymous with boxing, the company actually started out as a swimwear manufacturer in the Bronx in 1910.
The son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, 17-year-old Jacob Golomb grew dissatisfied with the flimsy swimsuits of the time, which barely lasted a season.
In response, he began making suits that he guaranteed would last for a full year.
He proudly gave them the name "Everlast," and although the swimsuits did not last throughout history, the name did.
In subsequent years, Golomb transformed his company into a small retail store that carried a full line of sports equipment.
In 1917, a young fighter named Jack Dempsey introduced boxing to Golomb and Everlast.
Dempsey asked Golomb to construct protective headgear that would last more that 15 rounds of intensive boxing training.
In 1919, Dempsey won the world heavyweight championship wearing boxing gloves made for him by Golomb, and shortly afterward, Everlast became the boxing equipment headquarters throughout the world.
Dedicated to leveraging the unique qualities represented by the Everlast brand--strength, dedication, individuality, and authenticity--the Everlast brand is now present in more than 101 countries and has 88 licenses worldwide.

Renown internationally as a manufacturer of boxing equipment, Everlast started out as a swimwear manufacturer in 1910.
Headquartered in the Bronx, NY, the company was founded by 17-year-old Jacob Golomb.

Golomb specially designed the training gear for Dempsey.
In 1919, Dempsey won the world&#x92;s heavyweight championship wearing boxing gloves made for him by Golomb.
Everlast became the headquarters for boxing equipment throughout the world.
In 1925, Golomb designed elastic-waist trunks to replace the leather-belted trunks then worn by boxers.
These trunks, now known as boxer trunks, immediately became famous.
Jacob Golomb ran the business until he passed away in the early 1950&#x92;s and his son, Dan, took over.
In 1958, Ben Nadorf joined Everlast and purchased 50% of the company from the Golomb family.
When Dan Golomb passed away in 1995, Nadorf purchased the family&#x92;s remaining 50% interest.
Nadorf remained the President and Principle Share Holder of Everlast until October 24, 2000.Everlast men&#x92;s and women&#x92;s apparel and accessories continue today to be tremendously successful both inside and outside the ring.

Headquartered in the Bronx, NY, the company was founded by 17-year-old Jacob Golomb.
The son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, Jacob Golomb was dissatisfied with the durability of swimsuits because they barely lasted a season, so he began making suits that he guaranteed would last for a full year.
He proudly gave them the name,Everlast.
Although the swimsuits did not last through the years, the name did.Over the next years, Golomb expanded his company into a small retail store that carried a full line of sports equipment.
In 1917, a young fighter named Jack Dempsey introduced boxing to Golomb and Everlast.
Dempsey asked Golomb to construct protective headgear that would last more than 15 rounds of intensive boxing training.
Golomb specially designed the training gear for Dempsey.
In 1919, Dempsey won the world&#x92;s heavyweight championship wearing boxing gloves made for him by Golomb.
Everlast became the headquarters for boxing equipment throughout the world.
In 1925, Golomb designed elastic-waist trunks to replace the leather-belted trunks then worn by boxers.
These trunks, now known as boxer trunks, immediately became famous.
Jacob Golomb ran the business until he passed away in the early 1950&#x92;s and his son, Dan, took over.
In 1958, Ben Nadorf joined Everlast and purchased 50% of the company from the Golomb family.
When Dan Golomb passed away in 1995, Nadorf purchased the family&#x92;s remaining 50% interest.
Nadorf remained the President and Principle Share Holder of Everlast until October 24, 2000.Everlast men&#x92;s and women&#x92;s apparel and accessories continue today to be tremendously successful both inside and outside the ring.
In addition, Everlast boxing trunks and equipment remain the proud and undefeated champion of the boxing industry for more than 90 years.

Planet Bike Super Spot 1-Watt LED Bicycle Light

Whether you're a 24-hour racer or a super commuter, the Super Spot bike light from Planet Bike gives you the power to light up the night.
Planet Bike's brightest LED headlight, the Super Spot is equipped with a 1-watt LED bulb that helps you see clearly at night while alerting drivers, other cyclists, and pedestrians to your presence.
The weather-resistant construction, meanwhile, lets you ride in wet conditions without fearing any problems.
And unlike many bike lights, the Super Spot's battery carriage works as efficiently with rechargeables as with traditional AA batteries.
The Super Spot, which comes with QuickCam bracket mounts that let you adjust or remove the light without tools, runs for up to 30 hours on four AA batteries (included).
It's also backed by a limited lifetime warranty.About Planet BikeIn November of 1996, Planet Bike was founded in Madison, Wisconsin.
In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way.
Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment.Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it.
From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled.
By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact.Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories.
Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world.
In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry.
Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light.
Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation.
Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes.
Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000.
By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists.

Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories.
Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value.
Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company.
Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937.
They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city.
Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves.
In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company.
When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior.
After that it wasn't long before business really started to take off.
Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric.
They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options.
In the early 1980s, then 60 year-old Gert began her role as "Mother Boyle" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign.
In 1998 the company went public, and moved into a new era as a world leader in the active outdoor apparel industry.
Today, Columbia Sportswear employs more than 1,800 people around the world and distributes and sells products in more than 50 countries and to more than 12,000 retailers internationally.What's in the Box?Frosty Ridge backpacking tent, aluminum poles, compression carry bagManufacturer WarrantyLifetime warrantyAmazon.com Tent GuideSelecting a TentFortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between.
Here are a few things to keep in mind:Expect the WorstIn general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face.
For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in!
If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.Three- and Four-Season TentsFor summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent.
At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly.
Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities.
Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model.
Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing.
Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability.
They also tend to be more expensive.Domes and TunnelsTents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright.
Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect.
Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design.
Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel.
These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration.
Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight.
Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.Size MattersAsk yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future.
For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents.
If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket.
Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room.
Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare.
A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents.
Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group.
It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories.
Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value.
Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company.
Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937.
They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city.
Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves.
In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company.
When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior.
After that it wasn't long before business really started to take off.
Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric.
They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options.
In the early 1980s, then 60 year-old Gert began her role as "Mother Boyle" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign.
In 1998 the company went public, and moved into a new era as a world leader in the active outdoor apparel industry.

For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in!

At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly.

Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:Expect the WorstIn general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face.
For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in!
If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.Three- and Four-Season TentsFor summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent.
At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly.
Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities.
Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model.
Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing.
Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability.
They also tend to be more expensive.Domes and TunnelsTents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright.
Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect.
Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design.
Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel.
These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration.
Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight.
Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.Size MattersAsk yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future.
For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents.
If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket.
Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room.
Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare.
A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents.
Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group.
It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories.
Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value.
Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company.
Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937.
They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city.
Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves.
In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company.
When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior.
After that it wasn't long before business really started to take off.
Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric.
They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options.
In the early 1980s, then 60 year-old Gert began her role as "Mother Boyle" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign.

Saris Bones 801 3-Bike Trunk Mount Rack

Form and function collide with the Saris Bones three-bike trunk mount rack.
Conceived by famed designer Fabio Pedrini, the Bones is more than just another rear-mounted rack.
Rather, the gallery-worthy rack is a testament to style, design, convenience, and durability, with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating fromBicycling Magazine.
An efficient bike rack needs to be more than just a way to transport your bike from point A to point B.
It needs to be easy to use, easy to install, and easy on two of your most prized possessions: your bike and your vehicle.
Fortunately, the Bones meets the above conditions with room to spare, with ratchet straps that keep your bikes secured to the rack arms, exclusive anti-sways, and articulated rubber feet to protect the finish on your vehicle.
As a result, nothing will get damaged in transport, including your nerves.
In addition, the Bones is a breeze to install, with vinyl-coated hooks that strap securely to the car with spring buckles.
And the arched design fits practically any vehicle, from sedans to minivans, and even most cars with spoilers.The Bones 3-bike rack fits on almost any vehicle.Constructed from heavy-duty, 100-percent recyclable plastic, the Bones rack is the strongest and most  rack on the market.
The injection-molded arms and legs will never rust, and are capable of supporting up to three bikes with ease.
Plus, the arms separate the bikes on different levels to ensure that they won't rub or touch during transport.
And because it's a trunk-mounted rack, your bikes are always accessible and easy to put in place.
No overhead lifting, twisting, balancing, or hefting required, letting you save your energy for the actual ride.
All Saris bike racks carry a lifetime warranty.Note:The pink and purple cause-conscious racks let you support more than your bike, as $5 from the sale of each rack goes toward either breast cancer research (pink) or research into the cures for leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma (purple).About Saris Cycling GroupSaris Cycling Group traces its origins back to 1973, when the Graber brothers invented their first bike rack.
The Grabers sold the bike rack company in 1989 to Chris and Sara Fortune, who created the Saris brand in 1992, and followed it up with CycleOps in 1999 and PowerTap in 2001.

Nikon Buckmaster 4.5-14x40 Riflescope

Nikon's renowned Brightvue multi-coating provides 92% light transmission for outstanding optical clarity.One of the world's best-known optics companies, Nikon Sport Optics, has teamed with one of the nation's most respected sporting organizations, Buckmasters, to produce a riflescope line featuring high-quality optics.Built to withstand the toughest hunting conditions, these scopes integrate shock-, fog-, and water-proof construction, as well as numerous other features rarely found on riflescopes in this price range.
Nikon's Brightvue anti-reflective system of multicoated lenses provides over 92% anti-reflection capability for the high levels of light transmission and optical clarity necessary for dawn-to-dusk big game hunting.
After the lenses are cut and polished, Nikon coats them with multiple layers of anti-reflective compounds.
The compounds serve to boost light transmission, improve contrast to pull game out of its surroundings, deliver true color rendition and flare-free viewing, and enhance the overall image quality.The brightest in its class, the Nikon Buckmasters riflescope has a proven track record of reliability, durability, and precision, making it a true hunter's workhorse.
The scope is at home on nearly any hunting rifle, muzzle loader, or even rimfire, boasting a rugged, one-inch main body tube, a bullet drop compensating (BDC) reticle for easy holdover out to 600 yards (magnum calibers), and ultra-high-performance lenses.The BDC reticle is perhaps the most compelling feature, as its trajectory-compensating system is designed and calibrated to provide fast, simple aiming points for various shot distances.
The unique system integrates a series of small "ballistic circles" to produce an unobstructed view of the targetThe bullet drop compensating (BDC) reticle provides fast, simple aiming points for various shot distances.Specifications4.5X to 14X actual magnification40-millimeter effective objective diameter8.9- to 2.9-millimeter exit pupil3.6-inch eye relief19.9- to 6.8-foot field of view at 100 yardsOne-inch tube diameter49.3-millimeter objective O.D.43-millimeter eyepiece O.D.14.4-inch length17.6-ounce weight1/4 MOA adjustment graduation50 MOA maximum internal adjustment50-to-infinite-yard parallax settingLifetime WarrantyNikon riflescopes include a limited lifetime manufacturer's warranty against defects in materials and workmanship.

Bushnell Golf Pinseeker 1500 Tournament Edition Laser Rangefinder

Your Bushnell Pinseeker 1500 is an advanced premium laser rangefinder comprised of digital technology that allows range readings from 5 to 1,500 yards.
Measuring 1.7 by 5.1 by 3.7 inches, the 10-ounce Pinseeker 1500 delivers superb and accurate range performance to +/- one yard.
The Pinseeker 1500 features Selective Targeting Modes, superb optical quality, 100% waterproof construction, and Bushnell's RainGuard coating.The Pinseeker 1500 emits invisible, eye-safe, infrared energy pulses.
Its Advanced Digital microprocessor and ASIC chip (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) results in instantaneous and accurate readings every time.
Sophisticated digital technology instantaneously calculates distances by measuring the time it takes for each pulse to travel from the rangefinder to the target and back.The ranging accuracy of the Pinseeker 1500 is plus or minus one yard under most circumstances.
The maximum range of the instrument depends on the reflectivity of the target.
The maximum distance for most objects is 1,000 yards, while for highly reflective objects the maximum is 1,500 yards.The Pinseeker 1500 features a powerful 7x magnification monocular for viewing your target.
Optics are fully multi-coated, allowing maximum light transmission for optimum brightness, superb resolution, and contrast for a clear vivid image even in low-light conditions such as dusk or dawn.
A liquid crystal display (LCD) is mounted within the optical system and, when activated, displays a reticle for targeting, yards and meters, and Mode indicators.Laser Rangefinder FeaturesStandard with Automatic ScanScan across the course while viewing a continuously updated LCD display of the distance between you and your target.Meters/YardsYou can quickly choose between these standard measuring units with a simple press of a button.ReticleThe distance to objects targeted in these crosshairs will be displayed on the Distance Readout with the press of a button.Battery IndictorFlashes when battery power is low.Target Quality GaugeGauge indicating amount of energy pulses being received back from the target.Pinseeker 1500 Targeting ModesBullsEyeGeared for close-range use, this mode acquires the distances of small targets and game without inadvertently measuring background target distances.

Accuracy is +/- 1 yard, and the distance is displayed instantaneously on a built-in, through-the-lens Liquid Crystal Display.How a Laser Rangefinder WorksBushnell's Yardage Pro rangefinders use an invisible, eye-safe Class 1 Laser beam (as classified by the FDA) which is "bounced" off distant objects with the press of a button.
Then, the rangefinder's high-speed digital clock measures the time it took for a laser beam to reach a target and return to the unit.
Next, using advanced digital electronics, the rangefinder instantly calculates the distance within +/- 1 yard and shows the range in either yards or meters on a through-the-lens LCD Display.
The entire process is so fast that less than a second elapses between the time you press the button to generate a laser beam to the time the exact range to your target is displayed.Reflectivity of Target TypesBecause rangefinders "bounce" a laser beam off the target in order to take a measurement, their range is partially determined by the reflectivity of the target.
In other words, hard or "reflective" targets -- like a rock cliff or semi-truck -- can be measured at greater distances than soft surface targets, like a deer.
Ranges for moderately reflective targets, like trees, fall somewhere in the middle.
Most experienced hunters will use their rangefinder to frequently estimate ranges to near and distant landmarks before they actually encounter a game animal.
By "pre-measuring" ranges to spots where a trophy is likely to appear, they can concentrate on making an accurate shot when the moment of truth arrives.

Lifetime 1221 Pro Court Height-Adjustable Portable Basketball System with 44-Inch Backboard

Hone your jump shot in your spare moments or perform a backyard dunking drill with this Lifetime portable basketball system.
Unlike in-ground basketball hoops--which are typically anchored in concrete--this portable hoop rolls on wheels, letting you position the basket support in your desired location, from the back patio to the middle of the cul-de-sac.
All you have to do is fill the 27-gallon base with water or sand and play.The Lifetime hoop adjusts from 7.5 to 10 feet in 6-inch increments.Lifetime knows that younger players aren't always ready for a 10-foot hoop, which is why the basket boasts a height-adjustment mechanism.
The telescoping mechanism adjusts from 7.5 to 10 feet in 6-inch increments--no tools required--letting players of all ages and skill levels enjoy the game on their own terms.
Aspiring dunkers can also gradually raise the basket 6 inches at a time as their vertical improves, although the 18-inch solid steel rim is not a breakaway rim.
The black rim is instead extremely stable, with 1/2-inch steel braces, welded steel net hooks, and a 50-gram net.And players needn't worry about the 44-inch backboard wearing dramatically over time thanks to the UV-protected, high-density polyethylene construction.
This sturdy plastic material helps the board resist chipping and cracking while protecting the graphics from fading.
Also equipped with a black, powder-coated, three-piece pole, the Lifetime system carries a five-year warranty.About LifetimeIn the beginning, all the founder of Lifetime Products wanted was a sturdier basketball pole for his backyard.
With this in mind, he found and purchased a piece of heavy-duty used pipe, a sheet of plywood, and a basketball rim.
The resulting backyard basketball standard functioned perfectly in his backyard.
Seeing the potential of his hoop, he placed an ad in the local free classified newspaper and made his first sale.
The rest--as they say--is history.
He created the American PlayWorld Company in 1973, based out of his garage in Riverdale, Utah.
After expanding into several other types of playground equipment, he eventually moved to a bigger location in South Ogden, Utah.
Several years later, the company transformed the basketball industry by introducing the Quick Adjust basketball pole, the first complete basketball system you could raise and lower with a broomstick.
In 1986, American PlayWorld created Lifetime Products, a separate company intended to concentrate specifically on manufacturing adjustable basketball systems.
In the ensuing years, the company has grown from having 18 employees in a 32,000-square-foot space in half a warehouse to more than 1,400 employees and 2.6 million square feet over 23 separate buildings.

Lifetime 1239 Pro Court Height-Adjustable Portable Basketball System with 42-Inch Clear Acrylic Backboard

Fun for the entire family, this portable basketball system can go anywhere you want to shoot hoops.
This system features a 42-inch acrylic backboard, three pieces of 3-inch round black telescoping pole sections, a black classic rim, direct mount extension arms, and a 27 gallon portable base.
The backboard is constructed of break-resistant acrylic, making it durable and rugged to withstand the elements.
The rim features a solid steel ring for stability; the all-weather nylon net is long-lasting.
The telescoping pole is adjustable in 6-inch increments by tipping the system and moving the telescopting pole to the desired length.
To stabilize the base, a 27-gallon capacity (about 234 pounds of water or 364 pounds of sand) allow for a stable foundation.Portable basketball systems depend on a base filled with sand or water for stability.
Although it will take up more space than an in-ground system, the portable base rolls on wheels, allowing players to position the basketball system in the desired location (and also allowing storage in a garage).
Simply assemble, fill the base and play today.
There is no fussing with concrete.Amazon.com Basketball System Buying GuideWith the high-quality construction of many portable basketball systems, turning your driveway into a basketball court can be as simple as hooking up your garden hose.
But while a portable system may ultimately be your best choice, there are reasons you may want to consider an in-ground or wall-mount system before you decide.In-Ground SystemsIn-ground systemsare permanently cemented into the ground--either via a bolt mounting kit or directly into the ground--and are generally more rigid and take up less space than portables.
In-ground systems often require that you hire a professional to complete the task, but when the cement dries you'll have a hoop that can take punishing dunks with ease.Many in-ground systems are height-adjustable, include removable post features that let you take the system down for off-season storage, and feature heavy-duty break-away rims.
You'll also want to research the adjustable mechanisms on the systems, as there are several types to choose from.
Some feature a counter-balance spring that lets you perform easy, one-hand adjustments while others may feature a sturdy, pneumatic system.Wall-Mount SystemsWall-mount systemscan be mounted to the side of a house, a tall retaining wall, or a garage.
Generally sturdier than portables, wall-mounts have the added advantage of optimizing your existing ground space for the court, since you won't take any space up with the base or pole.
Not all systems include the necessary hardware, so make certain you add a mounting kit to your list.Portable SystemsPortable systemsrequire minimal installation and offer ultimate convenience.
These systems generally feature a base that can be filled with sand or water to stabilize them and include wheels for portability.
Although they are not as sturdy as in-ground or wall-mounted hoops, portables are simple to set up and can often be folded for convenient storage.Backboard ConsiderationsRegardless of which system you choose, you'll want to brush up on Backboards 101.
Most residential systems feature backboards made of acrylic, fiberglass, graphite, or various other composite materials.
While clear acrylic gives the professional look and feel of glass, it is not as rigid as fiberglass or graphite.
Some systems may offer steel or aluminum backboards, which are virtually vandal resistant, but don't offer the true rebounding action.The regulation size of an NBA backboard is 72 inches wide and 42 inches high.
Most portable hoops are 42 or 44 inches wide and 36 inches tall.
In-ground systems tend to be a bit larger, with 54-inch and 60-inch widths being the most popular.
While rectangular shaped backboards provide more bank shot opportunities, they are generally more expensive than the streamlined fan-shaped board.
