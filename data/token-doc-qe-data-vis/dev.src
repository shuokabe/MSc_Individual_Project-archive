The Katadyn TRK Drip Gravidyn free-standing gravity filter features a 10 liter water container for large quantities of water.
It's ideal for the water supply for camps, cabins and homes without running water.
This Gravidyn version comes with three combined ceramic and activated carbon filter elements.Ceramic filters have a micro porous structure with impregnated silver which delays the growth of bacteria.
The pore-size of Katadyn ceramic filters is 0.2 micron (0.0002 mm).
Bacteria range in size from 0.2 to 5 micron and, like protozoa (1 to 15 micron), are efficiently filtered out.
Ceramic filters can be mechanically regenerated and the filter capacity is measurable.Activated carbon is used for its ability to reduce harmful organic and inorganic substances in the water.
It removes unpleasant tastes, odors, chlorine, pesticides (lindane, DDT) and trihalomethanes (THMs).
These substances adhere to the large surface area of the activated carbon.
Activated carbon granulate cannot be regenerated.Specifications:Technology: 0.2 micron ceramic depth filterOutput: ca.

Minor assembly is required before the bike can be used.Amazon.com Bicycle Buying GuideFinding the Right BikeTo really enjoy cycling, it's important to find a bicycle that works for you.
Here are some things to keep in mind when you're in the market for a new bike:The Right RideIn general, bikes are broken down into three major categories:Road and Racing Bikes--As a general rule, road and racing are built for speed and longer distances on paved surfaces.
Thinner tires, lightweight 29-inch (700c) wheels and drop bars that allow for a more aerodynamic position are the norm.
Most road bikes, regardless of price, offer many gears for tackling both hilly and flat terrain.Mountain Bikes--With their larger tires, hill-friendly gearing and upright position,mountain bikesare very popular for all types of riding, both on pavement and off.
Mountain bikes that are designed specifically for rugged trail use typically feature a suspension fork.
Some may have rear suspension, as well.
A quick change of the tires on any mountain bike--even one that you use regularly on trails--adds to its versatility and makes it a worthy street machine.Comfort/Cruiser Bikes--For tooling around on bike paths, light trails, or for cruising a quiet beach-side lane,comfort/cruiser bikesare the ticket.
With a super-relaxed riding position, padded seats, and limited or no gearing, these bikes are made for enjoying the scenery and having fun with the family.The Right PriceA bike's price boils down to three essentials: frame materials, bike weight, and component quality and durability.Entry-level--You'll find a wide range of comfort and cruiser bikes in this category, as well as some lower-end mountain bikes and road bikes.
Most will have steel frames and components that are designed to last for several years with frequent use.Mid-range--Bikes in this range may feature a lighter aluminum frame with mid-range components that keep performing after miles of use.
If you're looking for a quality bike that is relatively lightweight and will stand up to abuse, this is the "sweet spot."
Most serious commuter and touring bikes fall into this category, as do mid-range mountain bikes with a decent front suspension.High-end--Racers and serious enthusiasts who expect lightweight, high-performance components will want to stick to this category.
For road bikes, exotic frame materials (carbon fiber, titanium) and ultra-lightweight components can add thousands to the price tag.
Mountain bikes in this class often feature advanced front and rear suspension technology, as well as components designed to handle lots of rugged trail action.The Right SizeFit is crucial for comfort, control, and proper power and endurance on a bike.
Here are some basic bike fit tips:Stand-over Height--To find out if a bike's overall height fits your body, measure your inseam.
Next, determine how much clearance you'll need between your crotch and the top tube of the bike.
For a mountain bike, you'll want three to five inches of clearance.
A road bike should offer between one and two inches of clearance, while a commuter bike should have two to four inches.
Compare the stand-over height for a given bike to your measurements (inseam + clearance) to determine the right bike height.Top Tube Length--You can measure your torso to get a good estimate of proper top tube length.
First, make a fist and extend your arm.
Measure from the center of your fist to the end of your collarbone (the part that intersects your shoulder).
Next, measure your torso by placing a book against your crotch with the spine facing up.
Measure from the spine to the bottom of your throat (the spot between your collarbones).
Finally, add the two measurements (arm length + torso length), divide the number in half and subtract six inches.
This is your approximate top tube length.
Compare this number to a bike's posted top tube length.
You can allow for about two inches longer or shorter, as most bikes can be adjusted via stem length/height and saddle fore/aft position to make fine adjustments to the fit.Bikes for Women--Proportionally, women tend to have a shorter torso and longer legs than men.
Bike makers design women's bikes that offer a shorter top tube and many comfort/cruiser bikes built for women may also provide more stand-over clearance.The Right AccessoriesWhen you make a bike purchase, don't forget these crucial add-ons:Helmet (this is a must!

Minor assembly is required before the bike can be used.About MongooseIn 1974, BMX Products, Inc., later to be known as Mongoose Bicycles, launched from a humble garage.
The first of its kind, the BMX bicycle was named after bicycle motocross and was designed to fit the needs of the rough-and-tumble dirt-racing pastime that took its toll on wheels and bicycles.
The heavy-duty, one-piece cast-aluminum Mongoose Motomag wheel was soon born, and it was the first competition-ready BMX bicycle available.
Skip Hess, while in Australia pursuing his motor sports passion, came into contact with a strange and unusual cat-size animal--the mongoose.
Known for its passive nature while unprovoked, yet vicious and aggressive enough to kill a threatening Cobra twice its size, the Mongoose impressed Hess, who quickly registered the Mongoose trademark for his new bicycle racing frame.The Expert BMX bicycle model, which is still a cornerstone of the Mongoose BMX line today, was introduced in 1980.
Shortly after, Mongoose captured the first ever ABA National #1 Cruiser Title.
Previously known for the 20-inch bicycle, this title signaled the re-direction of Mongoose bicycles to larger-wheeled, adult-sized models.
Several years later, Mongoose continues to dominate the cruiser racing circuit with six National No.
1 Cruiser titles, leading to the introduction of adult-sized Mongoose all-terrain bicycles (ATBs).In 1992, Mongoose pioneered the full-suspension market with the introduction of the Amplifier.
This design is still the most-copied suspension design in the market.
Several year later, Mongoose launched the Newman adult bicycle frame, which is proven to be 15% stronger than any other bike frame in the market.
The design, while functionally sound, also raised eyebrows because of its distinctive look.In the next few years, Mongoose increased its marketing focus to dominate the bicycle industry, and more important, extend beyond it.
The Mongoose brand marketing initiative makes more than 100 million impressions.
Mongoose&#x92;s brand awareness increased by over 130% in 1999 and solidifies the No.
2 market share position in units and dollars.
Mongoose was acquired by Pacific Cycle, LLC, and continues to grow and prosper with more than 40 models of BMX, mountain, trail, freestyle, jumping, comfort, road, and cyclocross bikes.Amazon.com Bicycle Buying GuideFinding the Right BikeTo really enjoy cycling, it's important to find a bicycle that works for you.
Here are some things to keep in mind when you're in the market for a new bike:The Right RideIn general, bikes are broken down into three major categories:Road and Racing Bikes--As a general rule, road and racing are built for speed and longer distances on paved surfaces.
Thinner tires, lightweight 29-inch (700c) wheels, and drop bars that allow for a more aerodynamic position are the norm.
Most road bikes, regardless of price, offer many gears for tackling both hilly and flat terrain.Mountain Bikes--With their larger tires, hill-friendly gearing, and upright position,mountain bikesare very popular for all types of riding, both on pavement and off.
Mountain bikes that are designed specifically for rugged trail use typically feature a suspension fork.
Some may have rear suspension, as well.
A quick change of the tires on any mountain bike--even one that you use regularly on trails--adds to its versatility and makes it a worthy street machine.Comfort/Cruiser Bikes--For tooling around on bike paths, light trails, or for cruising a quiet beach-side lane,comfort/cruiser bikesare the ticket.
With a super-relaxed riding position, padded seats, and limited or no gearing, these bikes are made for enjoying the scenery and having fun with the family.The Right PriceA bike's price boils down to three essentials: frame materials, bike weight, and component quality and durability.Entry-level--You'll find a wide range of comfort and cruiser bikes in this category, as well as some lower-end mountain bikes and road bikes.
Most will have steel frames and components that are designed to last for several years with frequent use.Mid-range--Bikes in this range may feature a lighter aluminum frame with mid-range components that keep performing after miles of use.
If you're looking for a quality bike that is relatively lightweight and will stand up to abuse, this is the "sweet spot."
Most serious commuter and touring bikes fall into this category, as do mid-range mountain bikes with a decent front suspension.High-end--Racers and serious enthusiasts who expect lightweight, high-performance components will want to stick to this category.
For road bikes, exotic frame materials (carbon fiber, titanium) and ultralightweight components can add thousands to the price tag.
Mountain bikes in this class often feature advanced front and rear suspension technology, as well as components designed to handle lots of rugged trail action.The Right SizeFit is crucial for comfort, control, and proper power and endurance on a bike.
Here are some basic bike fit tips:Stand-over Height--To find out if a bike's overall height fits your body, measure your inseam.
Next, determine how much clearance you'll need between your crotch and the top tube of the bike.
For a mountain bike, you'll want three to five inches of clearance.
A road bike should offer between one and two inches of clearance, while a commuter bike should have two to four inches.
Compare the stand-over height for a given bike to your measurements (inseam + clearance) to determine the right bike height.Top Tube Length--You can measure your torso to get a good estimate of proper top tube length.
First, make a fist and extend your arm.
Measure from the center of your fist to the end of your collarbone (the part that intersects your shoulder).
Next, measure your torso by placing a book against your crotch with the spine facing up.
Measure from the spine to the bottom of your throat (the spot between your collarbones).
Finally, add the two measurements (arm length + torso length), divide the number in half, and subtract six inches.
This is your approximate top tube length.
Compare this number to a bike's posted top tube length.
You can allow for about two inches longer or shorter, as most bikes can be adjusted via stem length/height and saddle fore/aft position to make fine adjustments to the fit.Bikes for Women--Proportionally, women tend to have a shorter torso and longer legs than men.
Bike makers design women's bikes that offer a shorter top tube and many comfort/cruiser bikes built for women may also provide more stand-over clearance.The Right AccessoriesWhen you make a bike purchase, don't forget these crucial add-ons:Helmet(this is a must!

The Pure Energy Reactor regulator has a preset output pressure set between 800-900 PSI.
This air-system works great with any marker on the market, from Piranhas to Angels.
Because Pure Energy Reactor regulators are now re-buildable, this system is one of the most user-friendly, screw-in air systems in paintball.
On most markers you can expect to get 700-1100 shots from a full fill.
The exemption for Pure Energy&#x92;s carbon fiber bottle means you only have to have it re-hydrotested every five years.&#xA0;With the CFT piston and a streamlined setup, this air system is both extremely consistent over the chronograph and has very little drop off as you shoot the gas out of the tank (life of the fill).

Here are a few things to keep in mind:Expect the WorstIn general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face.
For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in!
If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.Three- and Four-Season TentsFor summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent.
At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly.
Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities.
Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model.
Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing.
Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability.
They also tend to be more expensive.Domes, Tunnels and SacksTents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright.
Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect.
Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design.
Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel.
These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration.
Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight.
Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.Size MattersAsk yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future.
For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents.
If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket.
Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room.
Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare.
A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents.
Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group.
It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

With the unique Play and Freeze Ice Cream Maker, you can make ice cream while on camping trips, at picnics, barbecues, and many other places.
You don't need electricity to make great tasting ice cream, but rather just add ice and rock salt in one end and ice cream mix in the other end.
Then, have a ball as you shake it, pass it, or roll it around for 10 to 15 minutes.
The ice cream mix can be as simple as cream, sugar, and vanilla or you can try a more adventurous flavor from the included recipe list or make up your own concoction.
Made of durable advanced materials, the Ice Cream Ball is lightweight, portable, and easy to clean.Step 1, fill with ice.Step 2, mix up ingredients.Step 3, shake it up.Step 4, enjoy.How it Works:Fill the ice end with as much ice as possible, then add 1/2 cup of rock salt to the pint size or 3/4 cup to the Mega size.
The lid should be hand tightened--do not use the wrench.Mix up your ice cream ingredients in a container, then pour the mix into the end with the metal cylinder, leaving about one inch for expansion at the top.
Hand tighten the lid.Have a ball!
Shake, roll, and pass it around as you mix and freeze the ingredients.
It's not necessary to shake the ball...just motion will do it.After about 10 minutes for the pint size and 15 minutes for the Mega ball, open the ice cream end using the included plastic wrench.
Scrape the sides of the cylinder to mix up the ice cream using a plastic or wooden spoon (don't use a metal spoon as it will scratch the cylinder).
Then check the ice end.
Pour out the excess water and add more ice and up to 1/3 cup more rock salt to enhance the freezing ability.
Close the lids securely and continue having a ball for approximately 5 to 10 more minutes (15 for the Mega).You will then have about a pint (or quart for the Mega ball) of delicious soft-serve ice cream.
The consistency will vary based on the ice, your mix, the outside temperature, shaking frequency, etc.
Once the ice cream is to the consistency of your liking, gently scoop it out and enjoy!Important tips for using your Play & Freeze Ice Cream Maker:Directions and recipes are inside the Ball.Use cream instead of half and half for richer tasting ice cream.Leave about an inch of space for expansion when you fill up the can with the ice cream mix.After 10 minutes (15 for Mega ball) of mixing (shaking, rolling, and passing), it is important to stir the ice cream mix (it freezes more around the can).
Also, drain the water and refill with ice and additional rock salt.
Have fun for another 10 to 15 minutes and you're done.Use the provided plastic wrench to open the ball, but not to close it.Pint Size Details:Weight When Empty: 2 poundsWeight When Full: 7 poundsIce Cream Capacity: 1 Pint/16 fl.

Sports_&_Outdoors@@Outdoor_Gear@@Camping_&_Hiking@@Camp_Kitchen@@Campfire_Cookware@@Lodge LCC3 Pre-Seasoned Cast-Iron Combo Cooker, 3-Quart

The Lodge Cast Iron 3-Qt Combo cooker is a multi-functional cookware that works wonders with slow-cooking recipes and all your favorite foods.
It's a deep skillet, a fryer, a Dutch oven and the lid converts into a shallow skillet or griddle.
This versatile piece of cast-iron cookware allows the preparation of almost any recipe.
Cast iron loves a campfire, a stovetop, or an oven, and can slow-cook foods without scorching.
It retains heat well so you can sear meat at higher temperatures and will keep your delicious meals warm for a long time.
Whether used in a kitchen or camp, theses virtually indestructible cookware should last for generations.
Made of cast iron, this Skillet evenly distributes heat from the bottom through the sidewalls.
Sporting a stylish black color, the cast iron Skillet looks good in most kitchens and it doubles up as an excellent source of nutritional iron.
This pre-seasoned skillet is ready-to-use right out of the box.
While the skillet comes pre-seasoned to prevent food from sticking, it works best when sprayed or lightly coated with vegetable oil before use.
The Lodge seasoning procedure is a multiple-step process in which the seasoning oil is applied via an electrostatic spray system that coats the cookware, then it&#x2019;s baked in commercial ovens at very high temperatures.
This allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the pores of the iron.
This seasoning process achieves a seasoned finish that would take many months of home use to achieve.
Sometimes during this process, the seasoning oil can collect and create a bubble or slight drip at the bottom of the pan as it&#x2019;s hanging through the production process.
And that in turn can turn brown as it&#x2019;s processed through the seasoning ovens.
&#xA0;This brown spot is not rust but in fact, carbonized seasoning and will darken with use.
&#xA0;The factory seasoning process makes Lodge cast iron products ready to use right out of the box, and the product over time &#x201C;Just keeps getting better&#x201D;.
After cooking, clean with a stiff nylon brush and hot water.
Using soap is not recommended, and harsh detergents should never be used.
Towel dry immediately and apply a light coating of oil to utensil while it is still warm.
Cast Iron, like your grandmother used, still ranks as one of the best cooking utensils ever made.
It gives you a nearly non-stick surface, without the possible harmful fumes generated by preheating chemically treated nonstick cookware.
The American-based company, Lodge, has been fine-tuning its construction of rugged, cast-iron cookware for more than a century.
Combo includes: 3-Quart Deep Skillet, Dutch oven base, and 10.25-inch lid.

Ideal for your glove box, utility drawer, or taking along for weekend trips at the cabin.About Swiss Army KnivesIn 1884, Swiss cutler Karl Elsener set up shop in Ibach-Schwyz, installing a waterwheel in Tobelbach Brook to run his grinding and polishing machines.
Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and "inox," or stainless steel.
Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives.
The forerunner of that name dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army.
Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor or versatility.
